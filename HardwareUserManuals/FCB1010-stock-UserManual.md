## 1. Introduction

Congratulations! With the BEHRINGER MIDI FOOT CONTROLLER FCB1010 you purchased
an ultra-flexible controller unit for a wide range of applications, whether you
are a guitarist, keyboard player or studio engineer: 10 BANKS with 10 PRESETS
each and two fully user-programmable expression pedals will give you enough
flexibility to manage your MIDI equipment. Guitar players will particularly
appreciate the option of selecting channels using two analog SWITCHES, as they
allow you to fully control both amplifier and effects from one “switching
center”. And with its ultra-rugged enclosure and built-in power supply the
FCB1010 is absolutely ready for the road, too. The easy-to-use programming
interface gives you fun instead of frustration, and invites you to fully exploit
the capabilities of your MIDI equipment.

**◊ The following user’s manual is intended to familiarize you with the unit’s
control elements, so that you can master all the functions. After having
thoroughly read the user’s manual, store it at a safe place for future
reference.**

### 1.1 Before you get started

**1.1.1 Shipment**

The FCB1010 was carefully packed at the factory to assure secure transport.
Should the condition of the cardboard box suggest that damage may have taken
place, please inspect the unit immediately and look for physical indications
of damage.

**◊ Damaged units should NEVER be sent directly to us. Please inform the dealer
from whom you acquired the unit immediately as well as the transportation
company from which you took delivery of the unit. Otherwise, all claims for
replacement/repair may be rendered invalid.**

**◊ To assure optimal protection of your FCB1010 during use or transport, we
recommend utilizing a carrying case.**

**◊ Please always use the original packaging to avoid damage due to storage or
shipping.**

**◊ Never let unsupervised children play with the FCB1010 or with its
packaging.**

**◊ Please dispose of all packaging materials in an environmentally- friendly
fashion.**

**1.1. 2 Initial operation**

Please make sure the unit is provided with sufficient ventilation, and never
place the FCB1010 on top of an amplifier or in the vicinity of a heater to avoid
the risk of overheating.

**◊ Before plugging the unit into a power socket, please make sure you have
selected the correct voltage:**

The fuse compartment near the power plug socket contains three triangular
markings. Two of these triangles are opposite one another. The voltage indicated
adjacent to these markings is the voltage to which your unit has been set up,
and can be altered by rotating the fuse compartment by 180°.
ATTENTION: This does not apply to export models that were for example
manufactured only for use with 120 V!

**◊ If you alter the unit’s voltage, you must change the fuse accordingly. The
correct value of the fuse needed can be found in the chapter “Specifications”.**

**◊ Faulty fuses must be replaced with fuses of appropriate rating without
exception! The correct value of the fuses needed can be found in the chapter
“Specifications”.**

```
Power is delivered via the cable enclosed with the unit. All requiered safety
precautions have been adhered to.
```

```
◊ Please make sure that the unit is grounded at all times. For your own
protection, you should never tamper with the grounding of the cable
or the unit itself. The unit shall always be connected to a mains socket
outlet with a protective earthing connection.
```

```

### 1.3 Control elements

**1. 3.1 Front panel**

(1)

(5) (6)

(2) (3) (4)

```
Fig. 1.1: Front panel control elements
```

(1) **FOOTSWITCHES 1** through **10/0**. These keys are used for changing the
presets, programming, entering values in programming mode and activating the
DIRECT SELECT function (10/0 only).

(2) **UP/DOWN** keys. These keys are used to navigate through different banks
and programming layers. When in programming mode, use the UP key for ENTER
(confirm) and the DOWN key for ESCAPE (cancel).

**◊ When DIRECT SELECT mode is activated (see chapter 2 “Programming the
FCB1010”), the UP/DOWN switches are no longer needed for BANK selection and are
free to perform a special function: in the GLOBAL CONFIGURATION menu you can
program them to control the SWITCH RELAYS (UP: SWITCH 1 RELAY, DOWN: SWITCH 2
RELAY). In this case, you can toggle between the preprogrammed SWITCH settings,
each time you step on these switches.**

(3) **EXPRESSION PEDAL A**. Allows you to change controller values continuously.
In programming mode, the pedal is used for data entry.

(4) **EXPRESSION PEDAL B**. Allows you to change controller values continuously.

(5) **STATUS LEDs**. The yellow LEDs display the current status of the PRESET
programming or GLOBAL CONFIGURATION functions.

(6) **LED DISPLAY**. Informs you about the currently selected BANK/PRESET
number. In programming mode, it displays any value changes.

(7) **FUSE HOLDER / VOLTAGE SELECTOR**. Please make sure that your local voltage
matches the voltage indicated on the unit, before you attempt to connect and
operate the FCB1010. Blown fuses may only be replaced by fuses of the same type
and rating. Some models allow for inserting the fuse holder in two different
positions, in order to switch over from 230-V to 120-V operation, and vice
versa. Please note that for 120-V operation outside Europe, you need to use a
fuse of a higher rating (see chapter 6 “Specifications”).

(8) **IEC POWER CONNECTOR**. Use the enclosed power cord to connect the unit to
the mains.

(9) Use the **POWER** switch to power up your FCB1010. Always make sure the
POWER switch is in its “Off” setting when you connect the FCB1010 to the mains.

**◊ Attention: The POWER switch does not physically disconnect the unit from the
mains. Always unplug the unit from the mains when you do not plan on using it
for prolonged periods of time.**

```
(10) SERIAL NUMBER. Please take the time to have the warranty card filled out
completely, and return it within 14 days after the date of purchase, so as
to be entitled to benefit from our extended warranty. Or use our online
registration option available on the World Wide Web under behringer.com.
```

```

```
(11) SWITCH 1 and 2. Use these jacks to connect your amplifier for channel
selection (mono or stereo phone jack cable).
```

```
(12) MIDI IN. The MIDI IN of your FCB1010 connects to a sequencer or similar
device, in order to download the memory data saved before with
the help of the MIDI SysEx function. Additionally, data can be looped
through the FCB1010 and merged with other data using the MIDI MERGE
function. Subsequently, the combined data are available at the
MIDI OUT/THRU connector.
```

```
(13) MIDI OUT/THRU. Use this jack to connect the devices you wish to control
from your FCB1010. The SOFT THRU circuit allows you to loop through any
signals present at the MIDI IN of your FCB1010, merge them with the unit’s
own data stream, and finally output the combined data at the MIDI OUT.
```

## 2. Programming the FCB1010

```
In this chapter you will learn to program your FCB1010 and adapt it to your
specific MIDI set-up. But don’t worry, you won’t have to learn a programming
language before you could give your FCB1010 a single MIDI command. The unit
will perform all functions for you, one after the other. Simply make and confirm
your choices. If particular functions prompt you to enter a parameter, this will be
covered specifically.
```

### 2.1 Selecting BANKS and PRESETS.......................................

```
There are two options to select a BANK and the PRESETS it contains. Which one
you use depends on the DIRECT SELECT parameter in the GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
menu. If DIRECT SELECT is on, you can use the PRESET footswitches to directly
select the BANK number followed by the PRESET number. If DIRECT SELECT is
off, you need to step through the various BANKS (using the UP/DOWN switches),
then select a PRESET from a bank. The default setting is OFF. The illustrations
below show the two options.
```

**2 .1.1 DIRECT SELECT deactivated**

Let’s assume you wish to select PRESET #1 from BANK #3...

**Step 1**

Use the UP/DOWN switches to go to the BANK that contains the PRESET of your
choice (here: BANK #3).

**Step 2**

Select the PRESET you wish to use (here: PRESET #1).

```
Step 2 Step 1
```

Fig. 2.1: PRESET selection with DIRECT SELECT disabled

**2 .1. 2 DIRECT SELECT activated**

If DIRECT SELECT is on, do as follows to select PRESET #1 from BANK #
(activating DIRECT SELECT is discussed in ch. 2.2.1):

**Step 1**

Select the BANK of your choice (here: BANK #3) by stepping on footswitch #3.

**Step 2**

Select the PRESET you wish to use (here: PRESET #1) by stepping on footswitch
#1. The display shows that preset 31 is selected.

```
Step 2 Step 1
```

Fig. 2.2: PRESET selection with DIRECT SELECT enabled

```
As this example shows, the DIRECT SELECT feature gives you a faster access to
BANKS and PRESETS than without this function. Which option to use is entirely up
to you. As long as you need the PRESETS from one BANK only, it will be advisable
to disable the DIRECT SELECT function because this way you can recall a new
preset with only one keystroke.
```

### 2.2 Global configuration

```
In the GLOBAL CONFIGURATION menu you can set the parameters that apply to
both the PRESETS and FUNCTIONS of your FCB1010 (e.g. MIDI channel selection,
SysEx SEND & RCV, DIRECT SELECT etc.). Keep the DOWN switch pressed during
power-up for about 2.5 sec to enter GLOBAL CONFIGURATION mode.
```

```
The DIRECT SELECT LED in the display lights up.
```

```
You can use the UP and DOWN keys to navigate through GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
main pages. Pressing UP leafs through the pages forward, pressing DOWN leafs
the pages backward. A corresponding LED indicates what page you are on.

```

```
◊ Only keeping the DOWN/ESCAPE key pressed for at least 2.5 sec. saves
your newly entered settings!
```

```
2.2.1 DIRECT SELECT page
```

```
Keep the DOWN/ESCAPE key pressed while you power up the unit. This takes you
to the GLOBAL CONFIGURATION menu; the green DIRECT SELECT LED lights up.
To activate DIRECT SELECT, press 10/0 key. The red LED lights up. Now, you have
to confirm activating DIRECT SELECT to be able to directly select presets. To do
this, keep DOWN/ESCAPE pressed for 2.5 sec. to exit GLOBAL CONFIGURATION.
The display now shows “00”. Now you can directly select the presets, as described
in ch. 2.1.2.
```

**2.2.2 MIDI channel setting**

To get from DIRECT SELECT to MIDI FUNCTION, press UP. The MIDI FUNCTION LED
flashes correspondingly.

This is where you determine the MIDI channels that can be sent from the FCB1010
for various MIDI functions. You can assign different MIDI channels to MIDI
functions, For example, you can control several pieces of equipment from your
FCB1010. The selection of MIDI functions is done via footswitches 1 to 10/0.
MIDI channel 1 is the factory default for all functions.

**• ** Press UP/ENTER to confirm the chosen value and to go to the next level,
or press DOWN/ESCAPE to cancel.

**2.2.3 CONFIG page**

The CONFIG LED lights up if you are on CONFIGURATION page. The following
functions, recalled via the footswitches (as in table 2.2), are at your
disposal:

```
Switch Function Action
```

```
1 SWITCH 1 Determines whether the UP switch controls SWITCH 1 relay ("toggle") with DIRECT SELECT on.
```

```
2 SWITCH 2 Determines whether the DOWN switch controls Switch 2 relay ("toggle") with DIRECT SELECT on.
```

```
5 COPY PRESET Enables copying presets (see ch. 2.4.1).
6 SYSEX SEND Sends the entire memory as a sysex dump.
```

```
7 SYSEX RCV
```

```
When this switch is pressed, the FCB1010 waits for the reception
of system-exclusive data. Switch LED goes out when the data
have been received correctly.
8 MERGE Allows to merge MIDI IN data with FCB1010-generated data. The combined data stream is subsequently output at the MIDI OUT.
```

```
9 RUNNING STATUS
```

```
Enables/disables Running Status feature. Serves to make efficient
use of the MIDI transmission rate. The MIDI Status Byte from
the Expression Pedals is sent only if it differs from the preceding
Status Byte.
```

Tab. 2.2: Assignment of footswitches in CONFIGURATION setup menu

```
◊ External equipment, for example guitar or bass amps, can be
controlled by using SWITCH 1 and 2 outputs of the FCB1010. If the
FCB1010 triggers this function, you should first check if the piece
of equipment you are trying to control reacts to connection state
(contact open or closed) or current feed (contact closed as long as
the switch is depressed). BEHRINGER guitar and bass amps react to
current feeds. Therefore, when you wish to remotely control channel
change on a BEHRINGER guitar amp not via MIDI but via switch outputs
(because you have no MIDI cable at your disposal), you have to power
off switch 1 & 2 LEDs in GLOBAL CONFIGURATION menu under CONFIG.
These LEDs are on in the default setting and indicate that programmed
connection state is kept.
```

```
Basically, CONFIGURATION mode functions are active as long as the corresponding
footswitch LED is lit.

For each of the 100 PRESETS you can determine which MIDI functions shall be
transmitted as soon as you select the respective PRESET. For instance, you can
send five different program change commands, two controller commands,
two different controller values (using the expression pedals) and a Note On
command to the connected equipment at the same time (menu structure as in
fig. 2.4). It is up to you to determine, which commands are stored in a Preset.
Do as follows to program the functions to be sent with each PRESET:
```

```
•	 Select the PRESET you wish to edit.
```

```
•	 Press DOWN for more than 2.5 sec to enter PRESET programming mode.
The number in the display disappears while the green SWITCH 1/SWITCH
LED in the display starts flashing.

status is indicated by the foot- switch LED and the corresponding
SWITCH LED in the acrylic display. For further details see chapter 3.
“Connections (general)”.
```

```
◊ Please note that the status of the SWITCHES can also be toggled with
UP (SWITCH 1) and DOWN (SWITCH 2) if DIRECT SELECT is enabled.
The only prerequisite is that this function has been enabled for both
SWITCHES in the CONFIGURATION menu.
```

```
•	 Confirm with UP/ENTER. The SELECT LED in the display lights up.
```

```
•	 Activate individual MIDI functions by keeping the respective footswitch
depressed for roughly 1.5 sec. Footswitch LEDs indicate the activated
footswitches of the respective MIDI functions. As long as the display
indicates SELECT, you can activate MIDI functions and select them for editing
by briefly pressing the corresponding footswitch. The selected footswitch
LED and the display blink during selection and activation. The NUMBER LED is
also lit. The following MIDI functions are available for selection:

2.4.6 Programming the NOTE function
```

```
The NOTE function allows you to send a MIDI note, for example, to use the
tap-tempo features offered by many MIDI devices or to play sounds the same way
you would on a keyboard.
```

```
•	 Select the PRESET you wish to edit.
```

```
•	 Keep DOWN pressed for more than 2.5 sec to enter PRESET programming
mode. The green SWITCH 1/SWITCH 2 LED in the display starts flashing.
```

```
•	 Use UP/ENTER to get to the next page. The SELECT LED in the display begins
to light up.
```

```
◊ To program a MIDI function, you have to first activate it. Individual
MIDI functions are activated by keeping the corresponding keys
pressed for a few seconds. Active MIDI functions are indicated by a
permanently lit footswitch LED.
```

```
•	 Keep footswitch 10/0 pressed for a few seconds to activate the NOTE
function. Pressing the footswitch briefly once again makes the footswitch
LED blink.
```

```
•	 Confirm your selection with UP/ENTER. The NUMBER LED lights up.
```

```
•	 Use the footswitches 1 through 10/0 or EXPRESSION PEDAL A to enter the
MIDI NOTE number you wish to send with the PRESET. You can choose from
the values 0 through 127.
```

```

programming mode by keeping DOWN/ESCAPE pressed for a few seconds.
```

The NOTE function will be particularly useful for so-called tap-tempo
applications. Many of today’s multi-effects devices allow the user to enter the
delay time by means of an on-board TAP button. The device measures the time
between two TAP button presses and uses this interval to adjust the delay time.
Often, this function can be remotely controlled via MIDI. In this case,
“tapping” is the transmission of two subsequent NOTE ON commands, which is what
the NOTE function of your FCB1010 does for you. For example, this is how a
sequencing software can be launched or closed.

**◊ If you program the NOTE function with a PRESET, a NOTE ON command will be
sent each time you select the PRESET. Getting your foot off the switch transmits
the NOTE OFF command.**

**◊ To “tap” the tempo, simply press the PRESET switch several times in the
rhythm of the music.**

**◊ CNT 1 is always transmitted together with the note on command. For example,
it can be used for sending a volume value (number 07) together with a note to
trigger a sound. When the controller’s operation is not desired, it can either
be relayed to an unused MIDI channel in GLOBAL CONFIGURATION (this channel is
then valid for all presets) or an unused controller number can be assigned to
the controller (can be done for each individual preset).**

### 2.5 Controller toggle function

This function allows you to configure one controller so that it alternately
sends two different values, e.g. effect bypass, drive on/off, etc.

**• ** In order to enable the controller switch-over function, you need to
globally select the same MIDI channel for CNT1 and CNT2 (see chapter 2.2), and
enter the same controller number for CNT1 and CNT2 in the preset
(NUMBER, see chapter 2.4.4).

The first time you recall the preset, it will send the controller value of CNT
(VALUE 1), with each additional key press you can alternate between CNT and
CNT1. Example: Select preset 1 without DRIVE function on the BEHRINGER
V-AMP—each time you press the same button again, DRIVE will be switched on or
off respectively: PROG CHG 1 = 1, CNT 1 NUMBER = 26, VALUE 1 = 0, CNT 2 NUMBER =
26, VALUE 1 = 127.

### 2.6 TAP-TEMPO function

In addition to the NOTE function, which is used by many effects devices to “tap”
the song tempo, the FCB1010 offers you another way to reach this goal: the
TAP-TEMPO function also allows you to enter the song tempo, however, transmits a
FCB1010-generated controller value to the controlled effects device, in order to
adjust the delay time. Advantage: you can also control devices that cannot
process NOTE commands, but only allow for changing the delay time by means of a
MIDI controller.

**◊ The TAP-TEMPO function does not work with DIRECT SELECT enabled.**

The TAP-TEMPO function has no dedicated switch, but is activated as follows:

**• ** Select the PRESET you wish to edit.

**• ** Keep the DOWN/ESCAPE key pressed longer than 2.5 sec. to get to the
programming mode. The green SWITCH 1/SWITCH 2 LED in the display
starts flashing.

**• ** Use the UP/ENTER key to get to the next page. The SELECT LED in the
display is lit.

```
◊ To program a MIDI function, you have to first activate it. Individual
MIDI functions are activated by keeping the corresponding keys
pressed for a few seconds. Active MIDI functions are indicated by a
permanently lit footswitch LED.
```

```
•	 Select the NOTE function you wish to edit by keeping the 10/0 key
pressed for a few seconds and then consequently tap it once again briefly.
The footswitch LED blinks.
```

```
•	 Confirm your selection with UP/ENTER. The NUMBER LED lights up.
```

```
•	 Enter the maximal possible delay time value for the equipment you wish to
control. Calculate the value that is to be entered for NOTE by dividing the
maximum delay time value by 10 ms. Confirm your selection with UP/ENTER.
The SELECT LED lights up.
```

```
◊ Please note that the FCB1010 allows for a maximum delay time of
1,270 ms, which is due to the MIDI standard’s maximum resolution of
7 bits (= 128 values).
```

```
•	 Activate control change 1 (CNT 1) by keeping the footswitch 6 pressed for a
few seconds. The footswitch LED lights up and is activated by briefly tapping
the footswitch (the LED blinks).
```

```
•	 Press UP/ENTER again. Now the FCB1010 prompts you to enter a controller
number. The NUMBER LED lights up. Enter the controller number which
the manufacturer of your effects device has preset for delay time changes.
Confirm your selection with UP/ENTER. The VAL1 LED lights up.
```

```
•	 The VALUE to be entered now corresponds to the upper limit of the
parameter range determined by the controlled device. That might sound
a bit confusing, but it’s quite easy: the manual that came with the device
usually contains an effects table listing the parameter range to be input via
MIDI in order to control the delay time. For example, the device might use
the entire range from 0 through 127; or a limited range from 0 through 63,
and so on. So, the VALUE parameter simply determines the resolution with
which the delay time can be programmed. The higher the value, the higher
the resolution.
```

```
•	 Confirm your entry with UP/ENTER. The SELECT LED lights up.
```

```
•	 Disable Control Change 1 (CNT 1) by means of a long foot- switch press on
footswitch #6. This is necessary because otherwise each time you select the
PRESET used for tempo tapping, the FCB1010 would transmit the controller
defined here (including the adjusted VALUE parameter), instead of the
FCB1010-generated value.
```

```
•	 Quit PRESET programming mode by means of a long press on DOWN.
Now, the TAP-TEMPO function is ready for use.
```

```
To use the tap-tempo feature, press the footswitch (which selects the PRESET
just programmed) twice in the rhythm of the music, e.g. every crotchet or quaver
note. The FCB1010 will calculate the delay time and send it to the receiving
device, by means of the controller you selected before. If the interval between
the two footswitch presses is greater than the maximum NOTE/NUMBER value,
the FCB1010 will divide the time by 2 until it is equal to or smaller than the
maximum value. Thus, a crotchet delay becomes a quaver or semiquaver delay,
depending on which value can be processed in the receiving device.
```

### 2.7 Data storage

**2. 7.1 Saving the FCB1010 memory with the help of SysEx dumps**

The FCB1010 allows you to transmit PRESETS in the form of system-exclusive data
to a sequencer or other MIDI recorder. In this way, you can save your data or
manage several MIDI set-ups (e.g. studio equipment, guitar equipment, etc.).

If you wish to save your data on an external sequencer/computer, please follow
the instructions below:

**• ** Connect the MIDI OUT of your FCB1010 to the MIDI IN of your
sequencer/computer (see fig. 2.5)

**• ** Keep the DOWN switch pressed roughly 2.5 sec during power-up to enter the
GLOBAL CONFIGURATION menu.

**• ** Press UP until the CONFIGURATION LED lights up. Now the unit is in
CONFIGURATION mode.

**• ** Start the RECORD function on your sequencer/computer. The footswitch LED
lights up and is no longer lit up when all SysEx data from the FCB have been
transmitted. Then press footswitch #6 to dump the FCB data. Quit the GLOBAL
CONFIGURATION menu by means of a long press on DOWN/ESCAPE.

To send back FCB1010 data stored on a sequencer/computer before, please follow
the instructions below:
```

```
•	 Connect the MIDI OUT connector of your sequencer or computer to the
MIDI IN connector of the FCB1010 (see fig. 2.6).
```

```
•	 Keep the DOWN switch pressed during power-up to enter the
GLOBAL CONFIGURATION menu.
```

```
•	 Press UP until the CONFIGURATION LED lights up. Now the unit is in
CONFIGURATION mode.
```

```
•	 Press footswitch #7 (SYSEX RCV) to “tell” the FCB1010 to wait for system-
exclusive data (the footswitch LED lights up). Start the PLAYBACK function
on your sequencer/computer to play back the previously stored file. The foot-
switch LED flashes while the FCB1010 is receiving data. Once the data have
been received correctly, the LED dies out. Now your programs are back in the
FCB1010’s memory. Quit GLOBAL CONFIGURATION mode by means of a long
press on DOWN.

### 2.8 Restoring factory presets

```
This function allows you to restore factory defaults of your FCB1010.
```

```
◊ In doing so, all preset settings made by you are overwritten!
```

```
Resetting your FCB1010 lets you restore various default settings that are
optimized for use with BEHRINGER audio equipment. This is why there are three
different key combinations that let you reload the desired defaults into the
memory of your FCB1010. This key combinations are shown in table 2.5:
```

```
Switch Default setting for
1 + 6 V-AMP family products
1 + 7 BEHRINGER guitar amps
1 + 8 BASS V-AMP product range
Tab. 2.5: Reset key combinations
```

Keep the respective footswitches pressed for roughly 2.5 sec while powering up
your FCB1010. The displays reads “09” to “00” and the points are blinking.
When the points are no longer shown, your FCB1010 has been reset to factory
defaults and is ready for operation.

### 2.9 Calibrating expression pedals A and B

Should you experience problems with exact MIDI controller data transmission
while using the expression pedals, we recommend calibrating the pedals.
Calibrating the pedals follows the complition of the FCB1010 self-test.

**◊ All software versions 1.4 and newer allow for direct calibration by keeping
the switches 1 and 5 pressed while powering up the unit. If your FCB1010
features the software version 1.4 or higher, skip the first 4 steps in the set
of instructions that follow (i.e. start at point number 5). To find if your unit
features version 1.4 or higher of the software, first try keeping the switches 1
and 5 pressed while powering up the unit. If nothing happens, start calibrating
your FCB beginning with the first step in the list that follows.**

**• ** Keep the switches 1 and 3 pressed while powering up the unit. This puts
your FCB1010 into self-test mode, and all LEDs are being tested.

**• ** Please wait until all switch LEDs light up. Then press all the switches,
including the UP/ENTER and DOWN/ESCAPE keys, so that all LEDs are turned off.

**• ** Wait for a moment while the relay test is completed (four quiet cliking
sounds are heard). The display shows F1 if no MIDI connection is present. If you
connected MIDI Out to MIDI In, the display shows A1. In this case, the MIDI
connections operate correctly.

**• ** Press DOWN/ESCAPE once.

**• ** Move the expression pedal A to the lowest value possible (pedal open).
The VALUE 1 LED lights up. When the value is adjusted, press the UP/ENTER key.

**• ** Move the expression pedal A to the highest value possible (pressed down
all the way). The VALUE 2 LED lights up. When the value is adjusted, press the
UP/ENTER key.

**• ** Move the expression pedal B to the lowest value possible. When the value
is adjusted, press the UP/ENTER key.

**• ** Move the expression pedal B to the highest value possible. When the value
is adjusted, press the UP/ENTER key.

Both pedals are now correctly calibrated.

## 3. Applications

Several application examples that should help you with the MIDI setup are
described in this chapter.

As long as your equipment features MIDI connectors, you can control it entirely
via the FCB1010. All you need is a MIDI IN connector at the other end.

No audio signal pass through the FCB1010 and consequently no signal processing
takes place in it either. The FCB1010 merely transmits control data to your MIDI
equipment, so it can for example call up presets, turn effects on or off, or
adjust volume. You can find more detailed information on this subject in chapter
4 “MIDI—A Standard, A Revolution.”

Here, the FCB1010 is used to control an effects device via MIDI. In addition,
the switch function is used to toggle between the two channels (clean/overdrive)
of the guitar amp. Please connect your effects device via the FX send/return loop
of your amp. Now connect the SWITCH 1 connector with the footswitch input of
your guitar amp. Use a standard jack cable for this purpose. Connect the MIDI OUT
connector of the FCB1010 to the MIDI IN connector of the effects device using a
standard MIDI cable.
```

The effects processor is controlled via MIDI, while the SWITCH function toggles
the amp. Thus, you’ll need no additional footswitch when you switch between the
channels; instead, your entire setup is centrally controlled from the FCB1010.

### 3.3 Connections (General)

Please use commercial-grade cables with phone plugs to connect the SWITCH
outputs of your FCB1010 to your amplifier. Since these outputs are normalized,
you can send both switching pulses from one SWITCH output, by using a stereo
cable, which is useful in combination with amplifiers that have a stereo phone
jack to select several functions (e.g. channel select and effect on/off). In
this case, please use only one of the two SWITCH outputs with one stereo cable
connected.

**◊ Find out whether or not your guitar amp supports a stereo connection via
SWITCH 1 or SWITCH 2. Simply try and experiment to identify the switching
configuration of your amp.**

## 4. MIDI—A Standard, A Revolution

In the early 80’s several leading manufacturers of electronic musical
instruments developed a common standard, which was soon to revolutionize the
entire MI industry—both from a technical and musical point of view. The MIDI
standard (short for: Musical Instruments Digital Interface) was invented to
allow musical instruments of different makes to communicate with each other.
What is surprising in view of the rapidly developing MI industry is the fact
that this standard has basically not changed ever since, because it was designed
with future upgrades in mind. So, the MIDI interface’s range of applications
could be expanded over the years: from the simple connection of several keyboard
instruments to one master keyboard to connecting whole studios and live set-ups
within a single MIDI network—MIDI has become an infinite source of ideas and
innovation. Numerous musicians recognized the versatility of this standard and
created new and exciting worlds of sounds by combining different instruments to
one homogeneous whole. It is important to know that the MIDI interface transmits
no audio signals but only control data (e.g. key, program change or volume
numbers)! MIDI is just an interface for the control and networking of devices
and instruments.

At the heart of this network you could use your FCB1010 to control all of your
amplifiers, effects and peripheral devices. Live on stage and in the studio you
could control your entire equipment in real time. MIDI control data can be
stored and edited on a computer, so that you can also use your FCB1010 to enter
controller and program change information into your computer.

### 4.1 MIDI connections

The MIDI connectors on the rear of the unit are on internationally standardized
5-pin DIN jacks. To connect your FCB1010 to other MIDI devices you need a
dedicated MIDI cable. Usually, commercially available cables are used.
However, you can also use a two-conductor shielded cable (e.g. microphone cable)
and two (rugged) 180° DIN plugs to make your own MIDI cable: pin 2 (center) =
shield, pins 4 and 5 (right and left of pin 2) = internal conductor, pins 1 und
3 (the two outer pins) are not used. MIDI cables should not be longer than
15 meters.

**MIDI IN** : serves to receive recorded system-exclusive data or to merge any
MIDI signals with FCB1010-generated data.

**◊ The FCB1010 has no dedicated MIDI THRU port. However, the data received at
the MIDI IN can be routed to the MIDI OUT provided that the MERGE function is
enabled (GLOBAL CONFIGURATION).**

**MIDI OUT** : The MIDI OUT allows you to transmit data to any MIDI-compatible
device/instrument.

### 4.2 MIDI data format

```
Although the FCB1010 is very easy to operate, it does make sense to know a few
things about the format of MIDI data. Each MIDI command or message consists
of up to three bytes (1 byte = 8 bits). There’s a difference between status bytes
and data bytes: status bytes define the type of a specific MIDI message, i.e. the
actual instruction to be sent to a device, while data bytes contain the information
or parameters defined by the corresponding status byte. One status byte can be
followed by up to two data bytes.
```

```
There are various types of MIDI messages. Since the FCB1010 does not understand
or transmit all of them, we will only deal with those that are of importance to you
in this context.
```

```
4. 2 .1 NOTE ON and NOTE OFF messages
```

```
NOTE ON and NOTE OFF messages are essential MIDI messages for any keyboard
virtuoso, as they allow to control remote instruments from one master keyboard
or computer. The FCB1010, too, can send NOTE ON messages, however, in a
different context: many effects devices allow for “tapping” delay times, etc.,
by measuring the time interval between two NOTE ON messages. With the
FCB1010 you can “tap” delay times or song tempos by selecting a “NOTE”
PRESET twice.
```

```
NOTE ON and NOTE OFF messages feature the following data format:
```

```
Status Byte Data Byte 1 Data Byte 2
Note Off &8n (n = Kanalnr.) Notennr. Velocity
Note On &9n (n = Kanalnr.) Notennr. Velocity
```

```
Tab. 4.1: Data format of NOTE ON and NOTE OFF messages
```

```
The channel number range is 1 through 16, the data byte range is 0 through 127.
It should be noted though that NOTE OFF messages are not so common today
(for reasons of data reduction, cf. running status). Usually, NOTE ON messages
with zero velocity are transmitted instead. The FCB1010 follows this convention.
By the way: when you program the NOTE function on your FCB1010 you only need
to enter the note number, because notes are always transmitted with a velocity
of 64.
```

```
4.2.2 CONTROL CHANGE messages
```

```
CONTROL CHANGE messages are the most powerful MIDI messages, as they allow
you to select and automate plenty of parameters and functions. On your FCB
you can define and transmit CONTROL CHANGE messages, e.g. to change specific
effects parameters in real time. The most important CONTROL CHANGE messages
are volume control (Controller 07), Balance (08), Panorama (09) and reverb
intensity (91).
```

```
4.2.3 PROGRAM CHANGE messages
```

```
PROGRAM CHANGE messages are used to change presets or sounds in connected
devices/instruments. The parameter range is 0 through 127.
```

```
The values 0 to 127 of the 128 presets are available. Equipment with more than
128 presets has these presets broken down into several banks for MIDI control.
```

```
With your FCB1010, it is possible to send MIDI bank and program change
commands by using just one keystroke. An external piece of equipment
(e.g. effects processor, sound module etc.) can be controlled via controllers 1 &
3 in connection with PRG 5 (PROG CHG). In doing so, controllers 1 & 2 are used
as 2-byte bank select controllers, whereby up to 128 (MSB) x 128 (LSB) banks
can be dialed in. Controller 1 needs to contain the number 00 and the MSB bank
value, while controller 2 needs to contain the number 32 and the LSB bank value.
The program change command that activates the preset in the new bank is sent
with PRG 5.
```

Almost all devices have a list enclosed which shows the program change number
versus preset number assignment. Some units even allow you to freely assign
program change commands to preset numbers. Please see the corresponding user’s
manual for detailed information.

**4.2.4 Running status**

Since the MIDI standard uses a serial transmission format, i.e. transmits data
successively, it was soon found that the transmission rate is too low if the
system is exploited to its full capacity. To make up for an audibly delayed
transmission of MIDI data, the so-called running status was introduced,
which suppresses the status byte in two or more identical MIDI messages that
follow each other. For example, if the data bytes of a controller (e.g. volume)
are changed continuously, the corresponding status byte is sent only once. Only
the data byte changes are transmitted, as long as another status byte is sent,
i.e. in each message transmitted you can eliminate 8 bits. This is also the
reason why NOTE OFF messages are no longer used. When a keyboard player plays a
scale on a keyboard and sends these data via MIDI to a computer, each NOTE ON
message would be followed by a NOTE OFF message, each time a key is released.
The running status would identify the NOTE OFF message as a new status byte and
hence send it, which results in a data amount of 8 notes times 8 bits, i.e. 
bits. Since NOTE ON messages belong to those MIDI messages that are used most
often, it was decided to send NOTE ON messages with zero velocity instead.
The audible effect is the same, but in the Running Status the data amount can be
reduced by 7 times 8 bits, i.e. 56 bits. As a consequence, the overall data
amount produced by the scale mentioned above is only 136 bits. With the FCB1010
you are free to switch the Running Status feature on or off (see ch. 2.2.3).
