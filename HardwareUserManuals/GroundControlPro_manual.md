for buying the Ground Control Pro, the finest full-featured MIDI foot controller
available. The Ground Control Pro is compatible with all MIDI controlled
devices. It provides the flexibility, ease-of-use, and rugged reliability
necessary to meet the needs of the most demanding professional players.

The Ground Control Pro allows you to simultaneously control up to eight
different devices, each on their own MIDI channel. It will also control up to
four GCX Guitar Audio Switchers and our System Mix Plus stereo mixer. But even
if you only use a modeling amp or a single processor, the Ground Control Pro is
the perfect choice to meet your performance needs.

The Ground Control Pro lets you instantly reconfigure your entire sound with the
touch of a single button. With the addition of the GCX Guitar Audio Switcher,
you aren’t limited to MIDI devices; your presets can also control pedal effects,
select amp channels, plus many other functions.

You can name each of your presets on the Ground Control Pro’s bright,
stage-friendly alphanumeric display. Plus it lets you use volume or expression
pedals to add real-time control of your sound using MIDI continuous controller
messages. This gives you access to effects such as wah and volume.

If you want to immediately use your Ground Control Pro to change programs on a
single MIDI device, read “Quick Start”. To get the maximum use and flexibility
from your Ground Control Pro, please take a few minutes and go through the rest
of this manual. If you are not familiar with MIDI, you may want to first read
the section “About MIDI.”

CONNECTIONS. Power. To use the supplied power adaptor, plug the body of the
adaptor into a suitable power receptacle. Then plug the cable into the jack
marked “Power” on the Ground Control Pro. If you have the GCX Guitar Audio
Switcher, you don’t need to use the supplied power adapter. The GCX will phantom
power the Ground Control Pro through a standard 5-pin MIDI cable. Note: If your
Ground Control Pro doesn’t power up from the GCX, here’s the problem... MIDI
only requires 3 pins, so to save money some cables only have these 3 pins wired.
Since the GCX uses the 2 unused pins to send phantom power, these cables won’t
work! You need to make sure your cable has all 5 pins wired. Cables with all 5
pins wired are often labeled “5-Pin Active”. If you are not using the GCX, but
have a device that supports phantom power via a 7-pin MIDI cable, this device
can power the Ground Control Pro. Connect the 7-pin MIDI cable from your Ground
Control Pro’s MIDI Out to the 7-pin MIDI In on the device. Then connect the
Ground Control Pro’s Power Adaptor to the phantom power jack on the device.
MIDI. Connect a 5-pin MIDI cable from the Ground Control Pro MIDI OUT to the
MIDI IN of your first device. If you are using the GCX, it should always be your
first device. If you have additional devices, connect the MIDI THRU of the first
device to the MIDI IN of the next device. If the device has no MIDI THRU, then
use its MIDI OUT. Continue to chain your devices until they are all connected.
In some situations you may want to remotely call up presets on your Ground
Control Pro, such as slaving it from a sequencer or having your tech control it
from off stage. You can also backup or edit your presets with a computer. To do
this, you’ll need to connect a MIDI cable from the controlling device’s
(computer, another foot controller, etc.) MIDI OUT to the Ground Control Pro
MIDI IN. Expression Pedals. There are two Pedal inputs on the Ground Control
Pro. Any passive Expression or Volume pedal can be used. You can tell if your
pedal is passive,because it won’t use a battery or require any external power.
The Pedal input jacks take a standard^1 ⁄ 4 " stereo plug. To use a volume
pedal, you need a cable INPUT OUTPUT GROUND CONTROL PRO VOLUME PEDAL RING TIP 12
INOUT 9VAC PEDAL MIDI POWER which breaks out a stereo plug to 2 mono plugs.
These are often called “insert point” cables. Connect the “ring” end to the
volume pedal input (sometimes labeled “instrument”) and the “tip” end to the
volume pedal output (sometimes labeled “amp”).

To use an expression pedal, you need a stereo^1 ⁄ 4 " patch cord. For detailed
information on how to setup and use expression pedals, please refer to the
section titled “Expression Pedals”.

QUICK START. You can use your Ground Control Pro right out of the box to select
programs on any MIDI controlled device. To do this, the Ground Control Pro must
have its factory settings. If you’re not sure, here’s how to restore them: Enter
Setup mode by pressing both [SETUP] buttons (the upper left and right) at the
same time. Press [UTILITY]. Press [SELECT 2 ] twice, it says “INIT MEM Y/N”.
Press [+/YES]. It says “YOU SURE Y/N” and press [+/YES] again. When it says
“WORKING...DONE” the memory is restored. To exit Setup mode, press either
[SETUP] button. It says “EXIT Y/N” so press [+/YES]. Remember, Quick Start is
for those users who want to just plug in your Ground Control Pro and use it to
control a single device as quickly as possible. To fully utilize its power and
flexibility, you should continue reading this manual! CHANGING MIDI PROGRAMS To
call up a program on your device, choose a BANK for the first digit by pressing
[BANK 1 or 2 ], then press [0-9] to choose the second digit. For example, to
call up program #21: Press [BANK 2 ] until you reach BANK 2. (The BANK number is
the leftmost digit in the display). Press [1] to Load (activate) Preset 21; the
display says: Your device should change to its program #21. To access programs
100 through 128, just press [BANK 2 ] and go to banks A (100-109), B (110-119)
or C (120-128). If your device isn’t changing programs, make sure that it’s set
to respond to MIDI channel #1. It can also be set for “omni”, which means that
it will respond to any MIDI channel. 2 1. INIT

SETUP MODE. Setup mode is used to configure the Ground Control Pro to properly
control your system. Setup mode is divided into the following categories: DEVICE
NAME/CHANNEL: Assign names and channels to each of your MIDI controlled devices.
PEDAL: Enable any volume/expression pedals being used as MIDI expression pedals.
EXPANDERS: Enable up to 4 GCX Guitar Audio Switchers and the System Mix Plus
Remote Volume (VCA). MIDI: Enable MIDI IN to receive program changes. Backup and
restore memory with MIDI System Exclusive. INSTANT ACCESS: Define the function
of the 8 Instant Access buttons. UTILITY: Change speed of directory scrolling.
Select number of presets/bank. Restore factory settings. SPECIAL: Load factory
setups for use with specific devices. Enter & Exit Setup Mode. To enter Setup
mode, press both [SETUP MODE] buttons at the same time. The Ground Control Pro
will display: Buttons 2 through 8 are also labeled DEVICE NAME/CHANNEL, PEDAL,
EXPANDERS, etc. While you are in Setup mode, you can press buttons 2-8 at any
time to select a new Setup mode category. To exit SETUP MODE at any time, press
either [SETUP MODE] button and answer [+/YES] to the prompt “EXIT Y/N”. Device
Name/Channel. This is where you setup your Ground Control Pro to be able to
change programs on your MIDI controlled devices, such as multi-effects
processors or a digital modeling amp. The Ground Control Pro is capable of
controlling up to eight different MIDI devices at the same time. Each of your
MIDI devices can be set to respond to program changes sent on a specific MIDI
channel (1-16). If you don’t know how to do this, please refer to that product’s
instruction manual. You’ll need to set each device to respond to a different
channel. For example, let’s say you have a MIDI preamp and a multi-effects
processor. You should set the preamp to respond to MIDI channel #1 and the
processor to respond to MIDI channel #2. SETUP MODE SELECT 2-

Note: You don’t have to enter anything here for the GCX or any non-MIDI devices
(like stompboxes) which will be switched through the GCX audio loops.

Enter Setup mode by pressing both [SETUP MODE] buttons at the same time. Then
select this category by pressing [DEVICE NAME/CHANNEL]. The display will read
something like:

Number The Ground Control Pro can control eight MIDI devices. This number tells
you which of the eight devices you are entering. Press [SELECT 1 or 2 ] to
choose a different device location. You can put each device in any of the eight
locations. The only difference is that this is the order that they will come up
in when you edit your presets.

Tip: The channel # is after the “/”. If this is “--” then that device location
is disabled. You may want to scroll through each location by pressing [SELECT 2
] and make sure that every location you aren’t using has a “--” for the channel.

Name Since after you have everything setup, it will be difficult to remember
which devices were assigned to which MIDI channels, we let you assign a name to
each device. Now, when you create and edit your presets you can refer to each of
your devices by their name. You should enter the actual name of your device
here, such as “MPX-1”, “EVENTIDE” or “TRIAXIS”.

The Ground Control Pro starts with device #1 named “DEVICE”. Devices 2-8 are
blank. You change the name using the [DATA] and [CURSOR] buttons.

Note: If you press and hold a button it will repeat. You can press both [DATA]
buttons at the same time for a space.

Channel Each of your devices must be set to respond to a particular MIDI
channel, 1-16. The channel must match the number you enter here.

Each of the devices (1-8) which are not being used must be set to “--”. This
turns off the device.

To set the channel:

Press and hold [CURSOR 4 ] until the channel is blinking. Press [DATA +/-] to
select the desired channel number or “--” for off. Note: Each device in your
system must be set to its own MIDI channel to respond properly.

Start Number Most MIDI controlled devices number their programs starting from 1.
If your device starts numbering its programs from 0, then the device will always
be off by 1 from what is displayed

Number Name Channel

1. DEVICE /

on the Ground Control Pro. You can fix this by telling the Ground Control Pro
that it should “start at 0”. Here’s how: Press [SELECT 1 or 2 ] to choose the
device 1-8 that you need to change. Press and hold [CURSOR 4 ]until the channel
is flashing. Then press [CURSOR 4 ] one more time. The display will read: Press
[-/NO] to select “STARTS AT 00” or press [+/YES] for “STARTS AT 01”. Pedal. To
use guitar volume or expression pedals with the Ground Control Pro as MIDI
expression pedals, you must enable them here. If you don’t know how to connect a
pedal to the Ground Control Pro, please refer to the “Connections” section of
this manual. Enter Setup mode by pressing both [SETUP MODE] buttons at the same
time. Then select this category by pressing [PEDAL]. The display should read: To
enable (turn on) the pedal connected to “PEDAL 1”, press [+/YES]. To disable
(turn off), press [-/NO]. Press [SELECT 2 ] to access “PEDAL 2”. Expanders. GCX
Guitar Audio Switcher If you have one or more GCX Guitar Audio Switchers, you
must enable them here. The Ground Control Pro can control up to 4 GCX units to
provide any combination of 32 audio loops and switches. Enter Setup mode by
pressing both [SETUP MODE] buttons at the same time. Then select this category
by pressing [EXPANDERS]. The display should read: To enable the GCX, press
[+/YES] to turn GCX #1 on. If you have more than one GCX, press [SELECT 2 ] to
access the next GCX. You can continue to enable GCX units 2 through 4. For most
applications, you will use loops as either audio loops or latching switches. If
you need to control a momentary switch function with one of the GCX loops, you
must change it from “normal” to “momentary” as follows: Press [SELECT 2 or 1 ]
to select the appropriate GCX. Press [CURSOR 4 ] to access the desired loop. The
display will look like: GCX-1 IS OFF

P1 ISOFF

STARTS AT 01

Press [+/YES] to select “MOM SW” for momentary switch operation. Press [-/NO] to
return to normal. System Mix Plus If your rig includes our System Mix Plus and
you’d like to use its MIDI volume feature (VCA), you must enable it here. From
the “Expanders” category, press [SELECT 2 ] until you see: Press [+/YES] to turn
the VCA function on. Note: When the VCA is enabled (“VCA IS ON”), you can only
use devices 1 through 7. Memory for device #8 is used to store volume levels.
MIDI. Receive Program Changes The Ground Control Pro can respond to program
change commands sent to its MIDI IN jack. This allows you to call up presets
automatically from a MIDI sequencer or to have your guitar tech do it from
offstage using another MIDI controller. To enable this function, enter Setup
mode by pressing both [SETUP MODE] buttons at the same time. Then select this
category by pressing [MIDI]. The display will read “PGM RECV OFF”. Turn it on by
pressing [+/YES]. Next press [CURSOR 4 ] to show the display: This is the MIDI
channel that the Ground Control Pro will respond to. In most cases the default
value of 1 is just fine. If you need to change it, use the [DATA] buttons to
select any channel 1 to 16. Memory Backup & Restore (System Exclusive) Your
Ground Control Pro can transmit and receive the contents of its memory using
MIDI System Exclusive messages. This is also sometimes refered to as a “bulk
dump”. This allows you to: •Keep a backup of all your presets. Create and edit
your presets on a computer. •Transfer the memory contents from one Ground
Control Pro to another. To transmit the memory, first enter Setup mode by
pressing both [SETUP MODE] buttons at the same time. Then select this category
by pressing [MIDI]. Press [SELECT 2 ] and the dis- play will read: CHANNEL- 0 1

VCA IS OFF

LOOP4=NORMAL

Press [+/YES] and you will see the message “SENDING MIDI” while the data is
being sent from the MIDI OUT jack. The Ground Control Pro can have its memory
loaded, either from a computer or from another Ground Control Pro. To receive
memory, enter Setup mode by pressing both [SETUP MODE] buttons at the same time,
then select this category by pressing [MIDI]. Press [SELECT 2 ] twice until the
display says: Once you see this message, you can load the memory back into the
MIDI IN jack. As soon as the Ground Control Pro starts receiving a valid System
Exclusive message, it will display: The number “001” will count up showing your
progress. When it has received the entire mes- sage, it will flash “DONE” for a
few seconds. Instant Access. The Ground Control Pro allows you to use buttons 1
through 8 for instant access. Normally, presets are organized in banks of 10. To
use the Instant Access feature, you must select the “ Presets/Bank” option. This
frees the upper two rows since you only need the bottom row of 4 buttons to
recall your presets. To select the 4 preset/bank option, enter Setup mode by
pressing both [SETUP MODE] buttons at the same time, then press [UTILITY],
followed by [SELECT 2 ]. The display should read: Press [+/YES] to select “4
PRST/BANK”. Now you’re ready to setup your instant access buttons. The factory
setting is for buttons 1-8 to control loops 1-8 in GCX #1, respectively. You can
redefine each button to control any one of the following: •Any loop of your GCX
Guitar Audio Switcher(s). Start and Stop a MIDI sequencer. Send a MIDI
continuous controller on/off message. To configure your instant access buttons,
enter Setup mode by pressing both [SETUP MODE] buttons at the same time, then
select this category by pressing [INSTANT ACCESS]. This display will show: 10
PRST/BANK

RECEIVED /

RECEIVE MEM

XMIT MEM Y/N

The first number “1” tells you which instant access button you are setting up.
Pressing [BANK 2 ] will select buttons 1 through 8.

GCX Loops Setting an instant access button to control a GCX loop means that you
can simply press that button to directly turn the loop on or off. This allows
you to be more spontaneous rather than hav- ing to create a whole new preset in
anticipation of which loops you’ll want on and off. The most common uses of GCX
loops are to switch stompbox effects in/out and to select amp channels.

When the display shows something like:

This means that instant access button ‘3’ will control loop ‘5’ on GCX ‘1’. Use
[CURSOR] to move between the GCX # and loop #. Then use [-/NO] and [+/YES] to
change them. You can select GCX #’s 1-4 and each GCX has loops 1-8.

Sequencer Start/Stop You can setup one of the instant access buttons to start
and stop a sequencer. With the cursor on the GCX #, press [+/YES] until the
display shows:

Now instant access button #3 will start and stop your sequencer.

MIDI Continuous Controller On/Off If you are using a multi-effects processor or
a modeling amp, it is very likely that you can turn its internal effects on and
off with MIDI Continuous Controller (CC) messages. By assigning CC messages to
instant access buttons, you can control these internal effects just like a
stomp- box pedal board. All you need to know is which MIDI channel (1-16) and
controller numbers (0-120) your device will respond to. Some devices will have
the controller numbers fixed to specific effects, and others will let you assign
each controller to a different function.

With the cursor on the GCX #, press [+/YES] until the display shows:

This indicates that Instant Access button #1 will control MIDI continuous
controller #004 on channel 1. You can use [CURSOR] to move between the channel
and the controller number. Then use [-/NO] and [+/YES] to select MIDI channels
1-16 and continuous controllers 0-120.

If you press [CURSOR 4 ] again, you can select between NORMAL, XMIT W/PRSET and
MOMENTARY. Here’s what that means:

1.CH01 CTL

\*\*3. SEQ S/S

GCX-1 LOOP GCX-1 LOOP\*\* NORMAL. The CC message is only sent when you press the
instant access button. You press it once to turn it on, then again to turn it
off. XMIT W/PRSET. This stands for “Transmit with Preset”. When you call up a
preset on the Ground Control Pro, it will send out the current state (on or off)
of this instant access button. Of course it turns on and off when you press the
button too. MOMENTARY. This option means that it sends an “on” message when the
instant access button is pressed, then sends an “off ” message when it is
released. Utility. Utility allows you to change the speed of the scrolling
preset directory, select the number of presets per bank, and reinitialize memory
to restore the factory defaults. Directory Speed This lets you control how fast
the directory of presets scrolls when you enter a new Bank. To change the
directory speed, enter Setup mode by pressing both [SETUP MODE] buttons at the
same time, then press [UTILITY]. The display will read: Press [-/NO] or [+/YES]
to change the value from 1 (slowest) to 4 (fastest). Presets / Bank You can
choose between having 10 or 4 presets in each bank. 10 Presets / Bank. With this
selection you will use buttons 1-9 and 0 to select your presets. Buttons [-/NO]
and [+/YES] are used as increment and decrement so you can step through the
presets sequentially. This is a great feature if you have a rigid set list and
want to pre-program all of the changes. You will use [BANK 1 or 2 ] to select
from 20 available banks, 0-9 then A-J. 4 Presets / Bank. This way you will
access your presets as banks of 4 presets each. You still use [BANK 1 or 2 ] to
choose the bank, but only buttons 1-4 on the bottom row (the large white numbers
on a gray background) to call up the presets. This frees the upper two rows for
instant access since you are only using the bottom row to recall your presets.
If you want to use the instant access buttons, you must choose 4 presets/bank.
The Ground Control Pro is initially set to 10 presets/bank. To change the
selection, enter Setup mode by pressing both [SETUP MODE] buttons at the same
time, then press [UTILITY]. Press [SELECT 2 ] so the display reads: Press
[+/YES] to toggle between 10 and 4 presets/bank. 10 PRST/BANK

Initialize Memory This function restores the Ground Control’s memory to the
factory settings. To do this, enter Setup mode by pressing both [SETUP MODE]
buttons at the same time, then press [UTILITY]. Press [SELECT 2 ] twice, so the
display reads: Press [+/YES]. After the warning and “YOU SURE Y/N” message,
press [+/YES] again. The initialization process can take up to 30 seconds. The
display will say “WORKING...” and when it’s finished it will briefly say “DONE”.
Special. Special lets you set up your Ground Control Pro to work with the Line6
POD and Flextone2. If you have one of these products, this is the quickest way
to get up and running. You can call up all of the amp models, plus use our 8
instant access buttons to have direct control of their built-in effects. Note:
This function will reinitialize the memory in your Ground Control Pro. It will
erase any settings you have already programmed. To do this, enter Setup mode by
pressing both [SETUP MODE] buttons at the same time, then press [SPECIAL]. Press
[SELECT 2 ] to display the correct device, such as: Then press [+/YES]. After
the warning and “YOU SURE Y/N” message, press [+/YES] again. The display will
briefly say “WORKING...” and when it’s finished it will flash “DONE”. POD?

INIT MEM Y/N

SELECT PRESET. The Ground Control Pro lets you create up to 200 presets. When
you recall a preset, the Ground Control Pro will set all of your MIDI controlled
devices to the correct programs. Plus, if you have one or more GCX Guitar Audio
Switchers, it will switch all the loops too. This allows you to completely
control your sound with the press of a single button. In the “Utility” section
of Setup mode, you chose whether you wanted to access your presets in groups of
10 or groups of 4. If you didn’t change this selection, the default is 10
presets in each bank. The following sections will explain how you recall presets
on your Ground Control Pro depending on which selection you have made. When you
power up the Ground Control Pro, it displays a startup message which you can
skip by pressing any button. Then it shows a scrolling directory of the presets
in Bank 0. 10 Presets / Bank. The 200 presets are arranged in 20 banks of 10
presets each. The banks are numbered from 0 to 9, then from A to J. Presets
within the bank are numbered 0 to 9. The display will look something like this:
The “07” at the beginning indicates that the Ground Control Pro is currently set
to bank #0, preset #7. The name of the preset is “RHYTHM”. If your Ground
Control Pro is new, the names of all your presets will be “INIT”. Once you start
creating your own presets, you will enter your own names for them. Creating and
editing presets is explained in the following chapter. To recall a preset, first
select the bank by pressing [BANK 1 ] or [BANK 2 ]. To move through the banks
quickly, hold down either [BANK] button and it will repeat. Then choose a preset
within that bank by pressing any of buttons [1] through [9] or [0]. Note: Use
buttons “1” though “9” and “0” to select your presets. These are the small
numbers which are in the top two rows and the left side of the bottom row. The
large numbers “1” through “4” on a gray background are used with the 4
presets/bank selection only. Forexample, if you’re currently in bank 0 (leftmost
digit is a 0) and you want to recall preset #21, press [BANK 1 ]twice to select
bank #2, then press [1] to activate preset #1 within that bank. You can also use
the [-/NO] and [+/YES] buttons to step through your presets one at a time. This
is a handy feature if you have a rigid set list and all of the changes are
already programmed in order. Another use is to select the first preset in a song
using the regular bank and number buttons, then use [+/YES] to step through the
changes within that song. When you change banks, the Ground Control displays a
directory of presets within the new bank. The directory will continue to scroll
until either a preset is selected or you return to the original bank. If you
forgot which bank you were in, when you get back to it the decimal point 07.
RHYTHM

following the bank number will light until it finishes scrolling the directory.
4 Presets / Bank with Instant Access. Using 4 presets/bank allows you to select
your presets using only buttons [1] through [4] on the bottom row. This frees
the upper two rows to give you 8 instant access buttons. You can define the
function of each instant access button in the “Instant Access” section of Setup
mode. The default is for them to control the eight loops of your GCX Guitar
Audio Switcher. The presets are arranged in 36 banks of 4 presets each. The
banks are numbered from 0 to 9, then from A to Z. Presets within the bank are
numbered 1 to 4. To recall a preset, first select the bank by pressing [BANK 1 ]
or [BANK 2 ]. To move through the banks quickly, hold down either [BANK] button
and it will repeat. Then choose a preset within that bank by pressing any of
buttons [1] through [4]. Note: Use buttons “1” though “4” on the bottom row to
select your presets. These are the large “1” through “4” numbers printed on a
gray background. The smaller numbers “1” through “8” on the upper two rows are
your instant access buttons. Buttons [1] to [8] on the upper two rows are your
instant access buttons. These are commonly used to make your Ground Control Pro
function more like a traditional stompbox pedalboard. They will switch actual
pedal effects on or off using our GCX Guitar Audio Switcher, or provide the same
function with “virtual” effects built into your digital amp or multi-effects
processor. You can press these buttons at any time. EDIT PRESET. When the Ground
Control Pro is shipped from the factory, it comes set up to control one MIDI
device responding on MIDI channel #1. The default presets call up MIDI programs
sequentially, meaning that Ground Control Pro preset ‘01’ calls up MIDI program
#1, preset ‘02’ calls up program #2, and so on. This is the same way that any
“dumb” MIDI foot controller works. The real flexibility of the Ground Control
Pro is that you can edit the presets to make each one do whatever you want. And
you can organize them in whatever order you want. Some players like to put their
favorite sounds in the first one or two banks for easy access. Others organize
them according to a particular set list. And still others dedicate one bank to
each song and that’s where they put all the sounds they use for that song. When
you edit each preset, here’s what you can do: Select the program for each MIDI
controlled device Specify what each of the two expression pedals will control
Set the System Mix Plus volume Set the loops on or off in up to 4 GCX Guitar
Audio Switchers Name your preset Note: Only those items which you have enabled
in Setup mode will appear. These changes occur in “real time” while you edit
your presets, so you can experiment with new tone combinations interactively
before you save them. Here are the basic steps to edit or create a preset:
Select the preset you want to edit. Enter Edit mode by holding down [EDIT] until
the Edit LED comes on. Use [SELECT 2 ] to step through each of the items within
the preset. When you are done, press [EDIT] again to exit Edit mode. Entering
Edit Mode. Before you enter Edit mode, you must first select the preset you want
to edit. The display will show something like: Now press and hold the [EDIT]
button until the LED above it comes on and the display changes. The delay in
entering Edit mode is so that you don’t accidentally enter this mode during
performance. Now that you’re in Edit mode, use [SELECT 2 ] to step through each
of the items within the preset. When you’re done, press [EDIT] again to exit
Edit mode. If you’ve made any changes, the display will show: 0 1. INIT

Press [+/YES] to save your changes, or press [-/NO] to exit Edit mode without
saving. Note: If you exit Edit mode without saving, your changes will still be
there until you select a new preset. So if you change your mind, just go back
into Edit mode and save it. Assigning MIDI Program Changes. After selecting a
preset, enter Edit mode by holding down [EDIT] until the edit LED comes on. You
will see the name of the first device that you entered in Setup mode. If you
haven’t changed the device in Setup mode, then you have only one MIDI device
named “DEVICE” which responds to MIDI channel #1. The Ground Control Pro display
will look something like this: Now enter the number of the program you want for
this device. You can access any program from 0 to 128. For example: For program
6, press [0] [6] For program 36, press [3] [6] For program 112, press [1] [1]
[2] Notice that there is a slight delay when you select programs 10, 11, or 12.
This is because the Ground Control is waiting for a third digit in case you
wanted programs 100 through 128. You can also press [-/NO] and [+/YES] to step
through your device’s programs one at a time. If you have additional MIDI
devices, press [SELECT 2 ] to go to the next one and enter its program. Note:
The Ground Control automatically filters redundant program changes when presets
are recalled to avoid audible glitches. So if you change from one preset to
another that has the same MIDI program specified, it won’t send the program
change command again. You can instruct the Ground Control Pro to not send a MIDI
Program Change with this preset. How you do this depends on whether your device
numbers its programs from 0 to 127, or from 1 to 128 (see “Start Number” on page
7). To not send a MIDI Program Change, do one of the following: If the device
starts at 1, then choose program 0 by pressing [0] [0]. If the device starts at
0, then choose program 128 by pressing [1] [2] [8]. When no program is selected,
the display will show “--” instead of a program number. Device Program Number

Controlling the System Mix Plus VCA. Before controlling the System Mix Plus VCA,
you need to enable the VCA from the Expanders category of Setup mode. For each
Ground Control Pro preset, you can assign a specific volume level, or you can
control the volume with expression pedals, or do both. Controlling the VCA with
Preset Volume Levels Volume changes can be programmed for each preset. Press
[SELECT 2 ] until you see the display: A value of “--” means no volume change
will be sent when the preset is selected. Press and hold the [DATA] buttons to
enter a preset volume level from 00 (off) to 99 (maximum). Controlling the VCA
with Expression Pedals To control the VCA with expression pedals, you set them
up just like in “Using Expression Pedals” below. Press [SELECT 2 ] until you get
to the pedal display for the desired Pedal (1 or 2): Press [CURSOR 4 ] to select
the target device. Then press [+/YES] to choose VCA. The display should look
like: Now press [CURSOR 3 ] to return to the previous screen. Use [DATA] to
select Stereo, Left, Right, or Pan. The expression pedal now controls volume
from 0 (off) to 127 (maximum). Using Both Preset Level and Expression Pedals You
may use both the preset level and the expression pedals simultaneously. When a
preset is recalled, the preset level will be sent to the System Mix Plus. The
expression pedal will override the preset level only when the value of its
position matches the value of the preset level. This avoids any drastic volume
changes when the pedal is moved. For example, if the Preset Level is 99 (maximum
volume), then the expression pedal won’t take control of volume until it has
reached its full on position. Then the volume will track the movement of the
expression pedal. If the expression pedal is assigned to Left or Right , the
preset level will control only the other channel of the volume control. For
example, if the expression pedal is assigned to the left channel, then the
preset level will control the right channel. P1-)-VCA-

Controlling the GCX Guitar Audio Switcher. The Ground Control Pro is capable of
controlling four GCX Guitar Audio Switchers for up to 32 loops. Before you can
control your GCX(s), you must enable them from the Expanders cat- egory of Setup
mode. To program loops on a GCX, first select a preset and enter EDIT mode. Then
press [SELECT 2 ] until you see: Now press [1] through [8] to turn on or off the
appropriate loops. The LEDs above each button show the current status of the
loop. If you have additional GCX units, press [SELECT 2 ] to select “GCX-2” and
repeat as necessary. If you don’t want the GCX loops to be changed, then you can
disable the GCX for this preset. To do this, while you’re at the “GCX-1” screen,
press [-/NO]. The display will flash DISABLED, then change to: To enable the GCX
again, you can either press [+/YES] or just change any loop by pressing one of
the buttons [1] through [8]. Using Expression Pedals. Before using expression
pedals, you need to enable them from the Pedal category of Setup mode. After you
select a preset and enter Edit mode, you can specify what each expression pedal
will control by pressing [SELECT 2 ] until you see the following display: Pedal
This tells you which pedal you are editing. Press [SELECT 2 ] again to select
pedal #2. Current Value This shows you what position is being read from the
expression pedal. It’s really just a diagnostic tool so that you know if the
pedal is working properly. Wiggle the pedal and make sure the numbers change and
your device is responding properly. If the numbers are changing, then the Ground
Control Pro is definitely sending the specified MIDI messages. Message Type Now
you need to choose a MIDI message type. It doesn’t matter which you choose as
long as it matches the message type that your device is set to respond to. The
choices are: Pedal Current Value Message Type P1. 064 CTL007

Controllers 000 through 120: “CTL007” To choose the MIDI message type press (or
press and hold) [-/NO] or [+/YES]. Some devices let you assign controller
messages to whatever parameters you like. Others will have a list of what each
controller does. You need to check the manual for the device you are controlling
to see how it works. Tip: Controller #7 (‘CTL007’) is almost always volume.
Target Device If you have more than one MIDI device, you must specify which one
the Expression Pedal should control. Press [CURSOR 4 ] to get to the following
display: Press [-/NO] and [+/YES] to select the correct device. Only those
devices that you have specified in the Device Name/Channel category of Setup
mode will appear. Naming Presets. To enter the name for your new preset, press
[SELECT 2 ] until you see: Press [-/NO] and [+/YES] to change the characters.
Press [CURSOR3 4] to move the cursor to each character position. Tip: To save
time, if you press and hold [-/NO] or [+/YES] they will autorepeat. If you press
them both at the same time, the character is replaced by a space. Saving
Presets. If you have made any changes to your preset, when you press [EDIT] to
leave Edit mode, the Ground Control Pro will display: Press [+/YES] to save your
preset. The Ground Control Pro will display briefly “SAVING TO 01” , before
exiting Edit mode. If you press [-/NO] instead, you will exit Edit mode without
saving your changes. Your changes will not be lost until you select a new
preset. SAVE Y/N

Saving to a different location (Copy) Sometimes you may want to save your preset
to a new location. This is useful when you want to start with an existing preset
and just change one or two things. Also, it allows you to copy presets from one
location to another.

To copy a preset to a new location, first select the original preset. Then enter
Edit mode by holding down [EDIT] until the Edit LED comes on. Then press [SELECT
2 ] until you see:

The first digit (bank#) will be flashing. Press [-/NO] or [+/YES] to select the
new bank. Now press [CURSOR 4 ] and the second digit (preset# within the bank)
will flash. Use [-/NO] or [+/YES] again to set this number. Then press [EDIT]
and the display will flash alternately between:

and the name of the PRESET currently in your chosen location. This will keep you
from acci- dentally writing over a preset you want to keep. You can press
[+/YES] to save or press [-/NO] to go back and choose a new location.

LINE6 POD & FLEXTONE II. The Ground Control Pro is a perfect companion to any
MIDI controlled digital modeling amps such as the Line6 POD and Flextone II. To
make it even easier to use with these devices, we have provided some special
setups already programmed in for you. First you need to initialize the Ground
Control Pro’s memory with our special setup. To do this, enter Setup mode by
pressing both [SETUP MODE] buttons at the same time, then press [SPECIAL]. Press
[SELECT 2 ] to choose either “POD” or “Flextone II” (all models). The display
looks like this: Then press [+/YES]. After the warning and “YOU SURE Y/N”
message, press [+/YES] again. The display will briefly say “WORKING...” and when
it’s finished it will flash “DONE”. Now you can exit Setup mode by pressing
either [SETUP MODE] button and answer [+/YES] to the prompt “EXIT Y/N”. To
access programs in your Flextone II or POD, use [BANK 1 ] and [BANK 2 ] to
select between banks 0 through 9. Then use [1] through [4] on the bottom row to
call up each program. The Ground Control Pro will show the names of each amp
model on its display. CONTROLLING INTERNAL EFFECTS The buttons [1] through [8]
on the upper two rows are your instant access buttons. Use them at any time to
control the following features of your Line6 product: When you call up a new amp
model, the LEDs above buttons [1] through [8] will show the current status off
these effects. If you want them to come up differently for that preset, after
you have changed them, press and hold [EDIT] until the Edit LED comes on. Then
press [EDIT] again so you see the display: FLEXTONE2?

EXPRESSION PEDALS You can use two expression pedals with these Line6 amps. Pedal
#1 will control volume and pedal #2 is the wah. You can use either one or both.
Plug expression or volume pedals into the Ground Control Pro according to the
instructions in Connections. Then you must enable them in Setup mode. To do
this, enter Setup mode by pressing both [SETUP MODE] buttons at the same time,
then press [PEDAL]. The display will read: Press [+/YES] to turn on pedal #1
(volume). Otherwise, press [SELECT 2 ] and press [+/YES] to turn on pedal #2
(wah). Now exit Setup mode by pressing either [SETUP MODE] button and answer
[+/YES] to the prompt “EXIT Y/N”. Both volume and wah are global on the Line6
amps. This means that when you change volume with the expression pedal, the amp
will stay at that master volume setting even if you select a new preset. The wah
is turned on by rocking its expression pedal. It will stay on until you press
[8], the instant access button assigned to wah off. P1 IS OFF

ABOUT MIDI. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a universal language
that allows electronic devices made by different manufacturers to communicate
with one another. Although using your Ground Control Pro doesn’t require a
thorough knowledge of MIDI, it is helpful to understand Channels, Program
Changes, and Continuous Controllers.

Channels MIDI Channels are like channels on your television. When you select a
channel on your TV, you only receive the broadcast transmitted on that
particular channel. Similarly, when you select the channel on a MIDI device, it
will only respond to messages sent on that Channel. MIDI messages can be
transmitted on 16 different channels (1-16) through a single MIDI cable.

Program Changes Your MIDI controlled devices have a series of programs which can
be recalled from the front panel. Programs can also be recalled by sending a
MIDI Program Change command.

MIDI Program Changes select one of 128 different programs. Some manufacturers
number their programs starting with 1 (1-128), some start with 0 (0-127).

Continuous Controllers Unlike Program Changes, which select an entire program,
Continuous Controllers change only selected parameters within a program. Also
known as Control Changes, these messages are frequently used to add expression
to an effect by adjusting parameters like volume, mix, reverb depth, delay time,
or EQ to name a few.

There are 121 different MIDI Continuous Controllers, numbered 0 to 120. Each
controller is like a slider or a knob; it can transmit a “continuous” stream of
values ranging from 0 (all the way off) to 128 (all the way on).

The Ground Control has inputs for two pedals which you can define to send any
MIDI Continuous Controllers you wish. The position of your pedal is converted
into a value from 0 to 127. Whenever the pedal is moved, the Ground Control
transmits a Continuous Controller message with the new value.

Each MIDI device supports Continuous Controllers differently, so you should
consult the manual for that device to determine which controller to use, and
what parameters may be controlled with it.
