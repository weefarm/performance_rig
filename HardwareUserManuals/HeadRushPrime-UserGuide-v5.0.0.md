## (4.0) Operation

This chapter describes HeadRush Prime’s functions.

### (4.1) Main Screen

#### (4.1.1) Overview

#### (4.1.2) Basic Operations

**Important** : The sequence of blocks in your signal chain is not necessarily
reflected in the footswitches. You can freely assign blocks to available
footswitches without changing your signal chain at all—and vice versa. See
**_(4.6.1) Hardware Assign > Footswitches_** to learn about this.

**To assign a block** (amp, cab, impulse response, effect, or clone) **to an
empty slot** , tap the () icon and then use the list that appears. See
**_(4.3.1) Rigs_** _>_ **_Creating a New Rig_** to learn about this.

**To show a block’s Detailed Settings screen** , double-tap it. Its settings
screen will appear with its preset menu, parameters, and assigned color. See
**_(4.4) Adjusting Settings_** to learn about this.

**To show a block’s parameters on the right edge of the screen** , tap the block
so it is outlined in green. You can then turn the **parameter knobs** to adjust
the parameters to their left. If a block has more than three parameters that you
would like to adjust, drag your finger up or down the column to bring the
additional parameters into focus. When no block is selected, the parameters will
be ones that you assign in the **_(4.6) Hardware Assign_** screen.

**To rearrange the blocks in your signal chain** , tap and drag a block to
another slot or between two other blocks (the block after that position will
shift one slot further down the signal chain).

```

**To activate or deactivate a block** , press the **footswitch** assigned to it,
or tap the block and then tap the **On/Off** button that appears at the bottom
of the screen.

**To switch an amp, cab, or IR between a dual and single configuration** , tap
the amp, cab, or IR, then tap the **X2** button that appears at the bottom of
the screen. See **_(4.1.4) Amp/Cab Doubling_** to learn about this.

**To remove a block,** tap and hold the block, and then drag it to the bottom
bar.

**To load another rig** (preset), do any of the following:

- Press the upper-left ( **Rig** ) or lower-left ( **Rig** ) **footswitch** to
  load the previous or next rig immediately while HeadRush Prime is in Stomp
  Mode.
- Tap the  or  next to the name of the current rig on the screen.
- Tap the name of the rig on the screen and then turn the **encoder**.
- Tap the bar below the rig name and drag downwards until a rig list is shown,
  then tap a rig to load it. When this list is shown, you can use the search bar
  to help find a specific rig quickly.

**To view other options** , tap the **menu icon** in the upper-left corner, and
then tap an option.

#### (4.1.3) Reverb/Delay Tail Spillover

HeadRush Prime features two types of Reverb/Delay Tail Spillover:

1. If you have reverb and/or delay effect(s) active on your rig and then switch
   to a different rig, the effect(s) will continue to decay after switching to
   the second rig.
2. If you have a reverb or delay effect active on your rig and then bypass this
   effect, it will continue to decay after it is bypassed.

**To enable or disable Reverb/Delay Tail Spillover for the whole rig** , tap
**Tail** on the main screen. Alternatively, press and hold the upper-left (
**Rig** ) footswitch for one second. **Note:** This feature will not work if
you are using an effects loop or if USB Audio is enabled in the Global Settings.

**To enable or disable Reverb/Delay Tail Spillover for an individual effect,**
first tap the effect in the **Main Screen**. Then, turn the **parameter knob**
corresponding to the **Tail** parameter and toggle between **Off** and **On**.
Alternately, double-tap the effect on the **Main Screen**. Then, use the
**Tails** parameter to toggle the feature **On** or **Off**. **Note:** Adjusting
this parameter will not impact the Reverb/Delay Tail Spillover setting for the
whole rig.

#### (4.1.4) Amp/Cab Doubling

When switching an amp, cab, or IR between a single and dual configuration using
the **X2** button, you can select from two options:

- **Stereo-Doubling:** When this option is selected, two amps, cabs, or IRs are
  placed left and right within a single slot to create a wider image. Both amps,
  cabs, or IRs will be active at all times.
- **Switch-Doubling:** When this option is selected, two amps, cabs, or IRs are
  placed within a single slot, and you can switch between the top and bottom
  amp, cab, or IR. **To use Switch-Doubling,** you must assign a footswitch to
  this function in your rig. In the Hardware Assign page, select the **Signal
  Chain** category of the **Footswitch Assignment Menu** , and choose from the
  following two options: **Doubling: A <Switch> B:** If there is one Switch-
  Doubled amp, cab, or IR, this setting assigns the footswitch to alternate
  between the top and bottom options of the block(s). **Both: A-B-C-D:** If
  there are two Switch-Doubled amps, cabs, or IRs, and one is located on the top
  path of a split signal chain and the other is located on the bottom path of a
  split signal chain, this setting assigns the footswitch to alternate between
  the four options of the block(s) in round-robin order.

### (4.2) Menu Screen

Most of the key features of HeadRush Prime are accessible from the **Menu**
Screen.

**To access the menu screen,** tap the **Menu** icon in the upper left corner of
the **Main** screen.

**To return to the Main screen,** tap the  icon in the upper left corner of the
**Menu** screen.

### (4.3) Rigs

When you are using HeadRush Prime, a **rig** is a preset: the combination of
assigned **blocks** —the amps, cabs, IRs, clones, and effects—and the parameter
settings of each of them. You can create, edit, save, and load rigs, making it
easy to recall the perfect sound for each part of your performance.

```
To access your rig from the Menu, tap the My Rig icon.
```

Each rig has **14 slots** , each of which can have one block (amp, cab, IR,
clone, or effect) assigned to it. An exception is when a slot is using an amp,
cab, or IR in a dual configuration (when the **2X** button next to it is
enabled).

Assigned slots will show graphical representations of the blocks, and empty
slots will show a  symbol.

#### (4.3.1) Creating a New Rig

**To create a new rig** , tap the  button in the upper-right corner of the main
screen, and then tap **New Rig**.

**To assign a block (amp, cab, IR, clone, or effect) to an empty slot** :

1. Tap the empty slot ().
2. In the list that appears, tap the type of block you want to assign.
3. In the list that appears, tap the specific block you want to assign.
4. In the next list that appears, tap the preset you want to load for that
   block.

As you add blocks, you will notice the CPU meter in the top left screen fill up.
There is no limit to the number of the same type of blocks you can add; however,
if this CPU meter reaches 100%, you may experience some unwanted tonal side
effects (popping, clicks, etc.).

If you are loading an impulse response (IR) file, you can select one that is
truncated to **1024** samples, which are less DSP-intensive, freeing up more
resources to load and use additional models and/or IRs to your rigs.

**To load a truncated IR** , select the **IR 1024** model instead of the normal
setting ( **2048** ) when adding an IR to your rig.

#### (4.3.2) Signal Path

The **signal path** is the direction that the audio signal follows from your
guitar, through your 14 available blocks, and ends at the outputs of HeadRush
Prime. You can easily reconfigure your signal path to best suit your needs,
especially when it comes to creating more complex rigs.

**To reconfigure the signal path** , tap the arrow next to the signal path
button, located at the bottom of the **Main** screen. An overlay with your
available signal chain routings will appear.

The following signal path options are available:

**Guitar: Straight Path**

```
This straight signal path is the default and the most common
for users that are creating non-complex guitar tones.
```

```
Guitar: Middle Split
This signal path splits in the middle and rejoins near the end.
This configuration is useful for using two types of effects (or
chains of effects) but want to keep their signals separate.
There are three separate Middle Split options:
```

- **Middle Split 3-4-3** features three slots after the Input, an eight-slot
  split Mix section, and then three slots before the Output.
- **Middle Split 5-3-3** features five slots after the Input, a six- slot split
  Mix section, and then three slots before the Output. **Note:** Middle Splits
  3-4-3 and 5-3-3 use the same singal path icon shape.
- **Middle Split 7-2-3** features seven slots after the Input, a two-slot split
  Mix section, and then three slots before the Output. See **_(4.4.2) Adjusting
  Settings_** _>_ **_Parameters_** _>_ **_Mix_** to learn how to mix the split
  paths together.

**Guitar: Immediate Split**

This signal path splits immediately from the source and rejoins near the end.
Like the second configuration, this one is useful for using two types of effects
(or chains of effects) independently, but it allows for more models in the split
paths and the rejoined one.

See **_(4.4.2) Adjusting Settings_** _>_ **_Parameters_** _>_ **_Mix_** to learn
how to mix the split paths together.

**Guitar: Dual Straight Path**

This straight signal path is the most common for users that would like to
connect two guitars simultaneously while maintaining separate singal paths for
each guitar. This can be useful for making easy switches between electric and
acoustic guitars on stage or playing along with a friend.

**Vocals: Straight Path**

This straight signal path is the most common for users that are creating
non-complex vocal tones.

**Vocals and Guitar: Straight Path**

These signal paths are the most common for users who want to utilize effects for
both guitar and voice.

There are three separate Dual Path options.

- **Dual Path 7-7** features seven slots each for vocals and guitar.
- **Dual Path 4-10** features four slots for vocals and ten slots for guitar.
- **Dual Path 2-12** features two slots for vocals and twelve slots for guitar.

**Optimizing Your Signal Path**

After adding blocks to a rig, you can use the touchscreen to arrange your
selected blocks in any sequence, but you may find that some configurations will
sound better than others.

Here are some common model placement suggestions for creating great rigs with
HeadRush Prime:

- Dynamics (e.g., **compressors** ), filters (e.g., **wah** , **pitch shifters**
  ), and **volume** pedals are generally placed at the beginning of the signal
  chain. Alternatively, you can place volume pedals at the end of the signal
  chain to provide a slight variance in functionality.
- Gain-based effects (e.g., **overdrive** / **distortion** , **fuzz** ) usually
  come next.
- Equalization ( **EQ** ) is often used to shape the tonal characteristics of
  overdrive/distortion and fuzz effects, so put an EQ after them. Alternatively,
  place it before them to shape the guitar’s general tone—cutting unwanted
  frequencies—before the gain pedals.
- Modulation effects like **flangers** , **phasers** , and **chorus** are
  typically placed next.
- Time-based effects like **delays** and **reverbs** are generally placed in
  between the **amp** and **cab** blocks (to simulate an amp’s built in FX
  loop), or near the end of the signal chain.
- **Amp models** , **cab models** , **IRs** , and **amp clones** are often
  placed near end of the signal chain, although you can place it wherever you
  want, depending on your needs.

**Switching Between Paths**

When using split path signal chains, you can use a footswitch or expression
pedal to toggle or blend between each path.

```
To toggle between split paths using a footswitch, use the
(4.6) Hardware Assign page to assign a footswitch to this
function in your rig. In the Hardware Assign page, select the
Signal Chain category of the Footswitch Assignment
Menu , and choose Path Mix: A <Switch> B.
Each press of the assigned footswitch will alternate between
the full top row split path in the rig being active and the
bottom row being muted, and vice versa. This option can
only be applied to split path rigs.
Note: You can also set this assignment as part of a Scene
by adjusting the Patch Switch parameter located at the
bottom of the Scene Assign page.
```

```
To blend between signal paths using the expression pedal, use the (4.6) Hardware Assign page to assign
the built-in or external expression pedal to the Mix > A <Crossfade> B assignment.
```

#### (4.3.3) Stereo vs. Mono

The outgoing signal from HeadRush Prime can be mono or stereo, depending on the
models in your rig, the signal path, and which outputs you are using. An
indicator near the end of the signal path indicates the current configuration.

The signal will be **stereo** if you do any **one** of the following:

- Use any stereo effect model in your signal chain. Even if you have placed mono
  effect models after it. (This is possible because the mono effect is simply
  applied identically to both channels and not summed.)
- Use a split signal path, even if the split paths rejoin before the output.
- Use a double-amp, double-cab, and/or double-IR configuration (i.e., if **2X**
  is **on** ).

The signal will be **mono** if you do **all** of the following:

- Use no stereo effect models in your signal chain.
- Use the linear (not split) signal path.
- Use only single-amp and single-cab configurations, if you use an amp or cab
  model at all.

Alternatively, the signal will be mono if you do any one of the following:

- Use only the **L** / **Mono output** (of a stereo pair) on the rear panel.
- Reduce the **Rig Width** output setting to **0%**.

**To adjust the width of the stereo field** , tap the **Out** icon at the end of
your signal path, and turn the third **parameter knob** to adjust the **Rig
Width** output setting. This affects stereo signals only, not mono signals.
**100%** uses the full stereo field, while **0%** produces a mono signal.

#### (4.3.4) Saving a Rig

If you have made certain changes to a rig, you will see an asterisk () next to
its name at the top of the screen, indicating that you have changed the rig in
some way and may want to save it.

You will see an asterisk if you have done any of the following:

- assigned a block to the rig.
- deleted a block from the rig.
- moved a block in the signal path.
- changed a block’s preset (see **_(4.4) Adjusting Settings_** to learn more).
- made any change in the Hardware Assign screen (see **_(4.6) Hardware Assign_**
  to learn more).

Activating or deactivating a block, using the parameter knobs on any screen, or
using the expression pedal on any screen will **not** cause the asterisk to
appear. You can save these changes to this rig, save these changes as another
rig, or discard them altogether.

If the asterisk is shown and you try to load a different rig, you will be asked
to select one of these options:

- **Cancel** : This option returns to the previous screen without saving the
  current rig or loading a new rig.
- **Discard Changes** : This option loads a new rig without saving any changes
  to the previous rig.
- **Save as a New Rig** : This option lets you save the current rig as a new
  rig. In the screen that appears, use the keyboard that appears to enter a
  name, and then tap **Save**. That rig will be saved, and the new rig will
  load.
- **Save Changes to Rig** : This option saves any changes you made to the rig
  and then loads the new rig. **Note** : Select **Do not show this dialog
  again** in the message to disable these confirmation messages. You can
  re-enable them in the **_(4.22.1) Global Settings > General_** screen.

**To save a rig** while you are editing it, tap the **Save icon** in the
upper-right corner. **To save your changes to the current rig** , tap **Save**.
**To save your changes as a new rig** , tap **Save New Rig** , use the keyboard

#### (4.4.2) Parameters

Listed below are some of the common parameters that you can adjust for each type
of block. The block types include amps, cabs, IRs, clones, effects, input
settings, output settings, and mix settings (if you are using a split signal
path). See **_(4.4.3) Saving a Block Preset_** to learn how to save a preset
after adjusting parameters.

**Amp (HeadRush / Revalver)**

The Amp category is a list of popular guitar and bass amplifiers.

```
Preset : This is the current amp preset, which includes the
model, all its settings, and its color assignment.
Model : This is the amp model.
Amp Settings : These are the settings for the selected
amp model (different models may have more or fewer
settings).
Out Level : This setting adjusts the overall output level
of the amp model without affecting its tonal
characteristics.
Color : This is the assigned color, which will appear in
the Hardware Assign screen and the switch indicator
if the amp is assigned to a switch.
```

**Cab (HeadRush / Revalver)**

The Cab category is a list of popular guitar and bass amp cabinets, which
contain the speakers. HeadRush Prime recreates not only the sound of the cabinet
but also the type of microphone recording it.

```
Preset : This is the current cab preset, which includes the
model, all its settings, and its color assignment.
Cab Type : This is the cab type. Numbers notated as
_X__ indicate the number of speakers it has and the
size of each speaker (e.g., 2X12 denotes a cab with
two 12-inch speakers, 4X10 denotes a cab with four
10-inch speakers). Numbers notated as __W indicate
the emulated wattage (output power) of the speaker.
Mic Type : This is the type of microphone being used on the cab. You can select different models of dynamic
( Dyn ), condenser ( Cond ), or ribbon ( Ribbon ) microphones.
Mic Settings : These are the settings for the microphone:
```

- **Break Up** : This determines the amount of speaker “breakup”—the natural
  distortion that occurs when the audio signal overdrives the speaker.
- **On-Axis** : This determines the microphone position relative to the cab.
  On-axis placement ( **On** ) positions the microphone at the center of the
  speaker, usually resulting in a brighter sound with more definition. Off-axis
  placement ( **Off** ) is slightly offset at an angle from the center of the
  speaker, and it often sounds darker in tone.
- **Out Gain** : This is the cab’s output gain level.
- **Amp Gain** : This is the amplifier’s gain level. **Color** : This is the
  assigned color, which will appear in the Hardware Assign screen and the switch
  indicator if the cab is assigned to a switch.

**Effects**

There are many types of guitar and vocal effects available on HeadRush Prime,
and their adjustable settings depend on the type of effect selected.

```
Preset : This is the current effect preset, which includes
the selected effect, all its settings, and its color
assignment.
Effect Settings : After the effect has been selected, you
can further dial in the effect by adjusting the
parameters that appear on screen.
```

**Amp and Pedal Clones**

A **Clone** is an alternative type of guitar/bass amplifier or
distortion/overdrive/fuzz pedal simulation that allows you to capture the sound
of your own gear and use it inside of HeadRush Prime. See **_(4.19) Amp
Cloner_** to learn more about how to capture your own clones.

```
Preset : This is the current Clone preset, which includes
the selected clone, all its settings, and its color
assignment.
Clone File : Tap here to select a previously created or
imported clone from your internal storage.
Clone Settings : After the Clone has been selected, you
can further dial in the clone’s sound by adjusting the
tone stack parameters that appear on screen.
Cab ON/OFF : You can use this setting to disable to
sound of the speaker cab from your Amp & Cab clone,
and instead use an onboard cabinet model or an IR
file.
```

**Speaker Cabinet Impulse Response (IR 2048/1024 Samples)**

A Speaker Cabinet Impulse Response **(IR)** models the tone and speaker
characteristics of a guitar or bass speaker cabinet, and is typically stored as
a .WAV file.

These files can be loaded to your rig by using the **IR (2048 Samples)** and/or
**IR (1024 Samples)** blocks, found in the **Cab/IR** category of the model
selector.

HeadRush Prime includes 300+ cabinet IR files onboard, however, there are also
many reputable third-party companies that capture and distribute IRs that can be
imported into HeadRush Prime.

You can load IRs at the highest quality (2048 samples) or at a lower quality
(truncated to 1024 samples), which is less DSP-intensive, enabling you to load
and use additional blocks and/or IRs to your rigs.

```
Preset : This is the current IR preset, including the selected IR, all its settings, and its color assignment.
IR File : Tap here to select a speaker cabinet IR file from your internal storage.
IR Settings : After the IR has been selected, you can further dial in the IR’s sound by adjusting the Gain , Hi-
Cut , Lo-Cut , and Mix parameters on screen.
```

**Convolution Reverb Impulse Response (C-Verb)**

A Convolution Reverb Impulse Response **(IR)** models the reverberation and
ambiance characteristics of an acoustic space, and is typically stored as a
.WAV, .AIF, or .OPUS file.

These files can be loaded to your rig by using the **C-Verb** effect, found in
the **Reverbs** category of the model selector.

The **C-Verb** effect allows you to explore your tone in a variety of acoustic
spaces using the included 50+ IR files or by importing IRs from third-party
companies for virtually endless tonal possibilities.

```
Preset : This is the current C-Verb preset, including the selected IR, all its settings, and its color assignment.
Reverb File : Tap here to select a convolution reverb IR file from your internal storage.
IR Settings : After the IR has been selected, you can further dial in the IR’s sound by adjusting the High Pass ,
Low Pass , Wet , and Tails parameters on screen.
```

**Important** : Only one instance of C-Verb can be loaded to each Rig. If a
multi-channel IR is loaded, only the first two channels are used. The maximum
supported length for a loaded IR is 10 seconds, and the CPU usage of this effect
will be determined by the length of the IR loaded.

**In (Guitar / Vocal)**

These input settings control the signal sent through the models of your rig:

```
Preset : This is the current input preset, which includes
all its settings and its locked/unlocked state.
Parameters : This menu determines whether these
input settings are locked or unlocked.
```

- When **unlocked** , the settings will change to the new rig’s input settings
  each time you load a new rig. The lock icon on the main screen will be
  **gray**.
- When **locked** , the settings will be retained as “global” input settings,
  regardless of the rig. The lock icon on the main screen will be **red**. **Rig
  Input** : This setting determines whether the rig’s input signal is taken from
  the **guitar input** ( **Guitar** ), or the right (R) **return input** ( **FX
  Ret R** ). This menu is shown only when **Rig Input** is set to **Per Rig**
  (in the global settings (see **_(4.22.2) Global Settings > Audio_** to learn
  about this). **Note** : The **Rig Input** parameter is available on **Guitar
  In** blocks only. **Input Level Meter** : This level meter indicates the
  current level of your input signal **before** the input controls shown on this

  sent from your guitar into your rig. The available range is **-60.0** to
  **12.0 dB**. **Note** : The **Input Gain** parameter is available on **Guitar
  In** blocks only. To control the Input Gain for a **Vocal In** block, use the
  **Mic Input Gain** knob on the rear panel of HeadRush Prime. **Gate Thrsh**
  (Threshold): This setting controls the signal level required to open the noise
  gate, enabling the guitar signal to be sent to the rig. The available range is
  **-120.0** to **0.0 dB**. The threshold is represented by a white line on the
  **input level meter**. **Gate Rel** (Release): This setting controls the
  amount of time it will take for the noise gate to close once the incoming
  guitar signal stops. The available range is **1** – **3000 ms**. **HP Filter,
  Noise Filter, EQ (Vocal Only)** : There are additional settings for a
  high-pass filter, noise filter, and EQ on the input block to help refine your
  microphone’s sound before any effects are applied. These parameters are
  available on Vocal In blocks only. **Note** : The **HP Filter, Noise Filter,**
  and **EQ** parameters are available on **Vocal In** blocks only.

**Out (Guitar / Vocal)**

your output signal after the output controls shown
on this screen. You can set which outputs will send
this signal in the Global Settings screen. See (4.22.2)
Global Settings > Audio to learn about this.
Rig Vol (Volume): This setting controls the level of the
audio signal sent from the outputs. The available
range is -60.0 to 36.0 dB.
Rig Width : This setting controls how much of the
stereo field the output signal uses. 100% uses the full
stereo field, while 0% produces a mono signal. This
affects stereo signals only, not mono signals.
Alternate Output : This level meter indicates the
current level of your output signal. You can set which
outputs will send this signal in the Global Settings
screen. The To Amp Gain setting controls the level
of this signal unless the Alternate Output source is
set to Rig Input. See (4.22.2) Global Settings >
Audio to learn about this.
Alt (Alternate) Out Gain : This setting controls the gain
level of the signal of the Alternate Output unless the
Alternate Output source is set to Rig Input (see
(4.22.2) Global Settings > Audio to learn about this).
The available range is -60.0 to 12.0 dB.
Dry Vol (Volume): This setting controls the level of the
dry vocal signal sent from the outputs. The available
range is -60.0 to 36.0 dB.
Note : The Alternate Output and Alt Out Gain,
parameters are available on Guitar Out block only,
while the Dry Vol parameter is available on the Vocal
Out block only.
```

**Mix**

These settings control mix of a split signal path. This is available only for
rigs with split signal paths (see **_(4.3.2) Rigs_** _>_ **_Signal Path_** to
learn more):

```
Preset : This is the current mix preset, which includes
its settings on the right edge of the display.
A Lev / B Lev (Level): These settings control the
volume levels the upper ( A ) and lower ( B ) branches
of the signal path. The range is -60.0 dB to +12.0 dB.

loaded. See **_(4.6.5) MIDI Out Messages_** for more information about this
feature.

###### (4.6.1) Footswitches

The eight boxes in the lower-left corner represent the middle eight footswitches
of HeadRush Prime. You can assign any switch-based parameters (ones with only
two states) to any of the footswitches—regardless of their location in the
signal chain.

You can also assign controls from the Looper, Metronome, and Practice Tool
features to a footswitch within a rig for easier access.

**To assign a parameter to a footswitch** :

1. Tap a box.  indicates an empty box.
2. In the list that appears, tap the block or feature with the parameter or
   control that you want to assign.
3. In the list that appears, tap the parameter you want to assign. Usually, the
   parameter will simply be **On** (to activate or deactivate it). Tap
   **Unassigned**  to unassign that footswitch.
4. On the Hardware Assign screen, tap **Latch** / **Momnt** / **Scene** for that
   footswitch to cycle through the available options: When set to **Latch** ,
   each press will turn the block on or off. When set to **Momnt** , pressing
   and holding the footswitch will activate it, and releasing the footswitch
   will deactivate it. When set to **Scene** , each press will turn a scene on
   or off. A scene is a collection of “linked” blocks in the rig—all of which
   will simultaneously turn on or off when you press that scene’s footswitch.
   See the **_(4.6.2) Scenes_** section to learn about this feature.

**To swap two assignments** , tap and drag one of them over the other, and then
release it.

**To edit the text displayed above the footswitch** , tap the text in the box
below the block name, use the virtual keyboard that appears to enter a name, and
then tap **OK**.

A footswitch can also be used to send up command of up to 5 different MIDI
messages when the footswitch is pressed and released. See **_(4.6.5) MIDI Out
Messages_** for more information about this feature.

###### (4.6.2) Scenes..................................................

The **Scene** feature allows you to turn multiple blocks on or off or change
multiple the presets for a block in each rig using one footswitch press. When
you press the footswitch assigned to that scene, all blocks included in that
scene will turn on or off, depending on how you assign them. This is a great way
to create multiple tones in the same rig. For instance, you may want a
particular reverb block to be on anytime a particular distortion block is also
on. Alternatively, you may want to turn one delay block off when you turn
another one on. Scenes enable you to do this with only one footswitch press.

**To create and edit a scene** :

1. On the **Hardware Assign** screen, tap **Latch/Momnt/Scene** for the desired
   footswitch to cycle through the available options, and select **Scene**.
2. On that footswitch, tap **Edit**. The Scene Editor will appear, which shows
   all models in your rig.
3. For each model in the rig, tap the **On/Off/No Change** field to cycle
   through the available options:
    - **On** : This block will turn on when you turn the scene on.
    - **Off** : This block will turn off when you turn the scene on.
    - **No Change** : This model will remain unaffected when you turn the scene
      on.
4. If you would like a block to load a preset when the scene is turned on, tap
   the **Preset** field, and select a preset. With this feature enabled, you
   change the parameters of a block by selecting a scene.
5. If you are using Switch-Doubling or a Split Path signal chain, use the
   **Doubling Switch** and **Path Switch** options to toggle between **A** /
   **B** / **No Change**.
6. If you would like to set up a command of up to 5 different MIDI messages when
   the scene is activated, tap the **MIDI Out** button to configure them. See
   **_(4.6.5) MIDI Out Messages_** for more information about this feature.
7. Tap a **color** at the bottom of the touchscreen to select a color for the
   scene.
8. Tap the  button in the upper-left corner to return to the **Hardware
   Assign** screen.

**To toggle between 2 scenes on 1 footswitch** :

1. On the **Scene Editor** screen, tap the  located next to Switch State 1, to
   add a second state.
2. Create the second scene using the editor as normal by choosing which blocks
   should be turned on, off, or have no chain.
3. Tap a different color for the footswitch LED to be shown when the second
   state is enabled by the footswitch.
4. Tap the  button in the upper-left corner to return to the **Hardware
   Assign** screen.

**To rename a scene** (which appears in the footswitch indicators), tap the text
in the box below **Edit** on the block on the **Hardware Assign** screen, use
the virtual keyboard that appears to enter a name, and then tap anywhere other
than the text field.

###### (4.6.3) Quick Parameters.................................

The right edge of the screen shows a column of fields for three parameters.
These are the three parameters that are shown first whenever you load a rig.
When no block is selected on the main screen, you can turn the three **parameter
knobs** to adjust these parameters. You can assign any continuous parameters to
these knobs (parameters with a range of values rather than ones with only “on”
and “off” states).

**To assign a parameter to a parameter knob** :

1. Tap the field to which you want to assign a parameter.  indicates an empty
   field.
2. In the list that appears, tap the model with the parameter you want to
   assign. You can also select parameters for the incoming signal ( **Input** )
   or outgoing signal ( **Output** ).
3. In the list that appears, tap the parameter you want to assign.

```
Tap Unassigned  to unassign that parameter knob.
```

###### (4.6.4) Expression Pedal

HeadRush Prime’s internal expression pedal can control two parameters (in
Classic Mode) or two sets of four parameters (in Advanced Mode) or two sets of
two parameters (in Auto-Engage Mode). Use the toe switch to switch between
them—Expression Pedal **A** or **B**.

```
To activate the toe switch , move the “toe end” of the expression pedal so it touches the Prime, and then
press down. The expression pedal status LED will indicate A or B.
```

**Note:** When you save your rig, the current selected Expression Pedal state (A
or B) will be saved and then recalled when you load the rig again.

When an external expression pedal with a toe switch is connected it can also
control parameters in Classic, Advanced, or Auto-Engage Mode. Use the external
pedal’s toe switch to switch between them—Expression Pedal **C** or **D**.

The column of four boxes represents the expression pedal settings. You can
assign one or more continuously adjustable parameters (ones with a range of
values) to the expression pedal.

```
To set the expression pedal mode , tap the button above Range in the upper-right
corner to select Classic, Advanced , or Auto-Engage.
```

- **Classic** : You can assign one parameter to each expression pedal ( **A**
  and **B** if using the internal pedal **, C** and **D** if using an external
  pedal). Using the toe switch will select the other expression pedal and
  deactivate (bypass) the current expression pedal’s parameter. For instance, if
  you assign a wah pedal to Expression Pedal A and a volume pedal to Expression
  Pedal B, only one of them will be active at any time; when you are controlling
  the wah pedal, the volume pedal will be bypassed, and vice versa.
- **Advanced** : You can assign up to four parameters to each expression pedal (
  **A** and **B** if using the internal pedal **, C** and **D** if using an
  external pedal). Moving the pedal will adjust all its assigned parameters
  simultaneously. Using the toe switch will select the other expression pedal
  and leave the current pedal’s parameters active and at their maximum values.

###### • Auto-Engage: You can assign up to two parameters to each expression pedal

```
( A , B, C, D ). In this mode, you can deactivate (bypass) the current expression
pedal’s parameter(s) by moving it to the Toe Up , Toe Down , or Stop position,
depending on your Off Pos (Position) setting. You can also set an Off Delay time
(0–5000 ms) that determines how long it will take for the parameter(s) to bypass
when the expression pedal is moved to the Off Position. Like in Classic mode,
using the toe switch will still select the other expression pedal (A or B, C or D) and
```

###### deactivate (bypass) the current expression pedal’s parameter(s).

**Important** : You **cannot** edit any parameters assigned to the expression
pedal in **Classic Mode** (they will show a lock icon and be grayed out in other
screens to indicate this). You **can** edit any parameters assigned to the
expression pedal in **Advanced Mode** or **Auto-Engage Mode** (they will show a
pedal icon in other screens to indicate this).

**To assign a parameter to the expression pedal** :

1. If the **Assign** button is not on, tap it.
2. Tap a box under the **Assign** button.  indicates an empty box.
3. In the list that appears, tap the model with the parameter you want to
   assign.
4. In the list that appears, tap the parameter you want to assign. Tap
   **Unassigned**  to unassign that box.

**To set the range of an assigned parameter** :

1. If the **Range** button is not on, tap it.
2. Tap a value under the **Range** button.
3. Turn the **encoder** to set the desired value as a percentage of the
   parameter’s entire range. Press the **encoder** or tap elsewhere to confirm
   the value.

###### (4.6.5) MIDI Out Messages..............................

The HeadRush Prime can send a command of up to five MIDI messages to its 5-PIN
MIDI DIN output when a rig is

###### loaded, when a scene is activated, or when a footswitch is pressed.

**To assign MIDI messages to be sent when a rig is loaded** , tap the MIDI SEND
button on the **Hardware Assign** page.

**To assign MIDI messages to be sent when activating a scene** , tap the MIDI
OUT button on the **Scene Edit** page.

**To assign MIDI messages to be sent when using an assigned footswitch within
the rig** , tap one of the footswitch assignment blocks on the Hardware Assign
Page and then choose **MIDI OUT** > **New/Edit...**

**To configure a MIDI command** , tap the buttons labeled **1, 2, 3, 4, or 5**
to choose one of the five configurable messages, then set the parameters for the
message by tapping on each button and turning the **encoder**.

You can select the following types of MIDI messages for each of these 5
configurable MIDI messages:

- **Program Change**

```
o Available Settings: MIDI Channel, MSB, LSB, and

Velocity
```

**Important** : If you plan to send Program Change messages, Use the **Prog
Change** setting in the \*\*Global Settings

> MIDI** menu to determine whether HeadRush Prime should receive or send MIDI
> program change messages. (see **_(4.22.6) Global Settings > MIDI_\*\* for more
> information).

**To test the MIDI command while configuring** , tap the **TEST** button to send
it to the MIDI output.

Your configured MIDI commands will be stored as a preset for easy recall when
building new rigs or editing older rigs in the future.

```
To save a MIDI command preset , tap the Save icon in the top bar.

```
To save your MIDI parameters and confirm the assignment , tap APPLY.
To unassign the command from the footswitch, scene, or rig load , tap UNASSIGN.
To cancel any changes and return to the previous screen , tap CANCEL.
```

**Important** : When assigning a MIDI command to a footswitch, you can assign it
to specific toggle states of the footswitch using the **TOGGLE STATE**
parameter.

When the footswitch is set to **LATCH** on the main hardware assign page **,**
any messages assigned to **Toggle State 1** will be sent on the first press of
the footswitch, then any messages assigned to **Toggle State 2** will be sent on
the next press of the footswitch, and so forth.

When the footswitch is set to **MOMNT** on the main hardware assign page, any
messages assigned to **Toggle State 1** will be sent on the press of the
footswitch, then any messages assigned to **Toggle State 2** will be sent on the
release of the footswitch.

This **TOGGLE STATE** parameter is not available when assigning a MIDI command
to be sent on **Rig Load**. For assigning a MIDI command to a **Scene** , you
can use the **SWITCH STATE** parameter on the main **Scene Edit** page to choose
which switch state that the MIDI messages should be sent.

##### (4.7) Hands-Free Mode

Hands-Free Mode enables you to adjust any of the settings on your blocks by
using just the footswitches and expression pedal.

**To enter Hands-Free Mode** , press and hold a **footswitch** assigned to a
block for over one second. While in Hands-Free Mode, the screen will show a
single parameter and its value, and the top six footswitches will correspond to
six parameters of that model.

**To exit Hands-Free Mode** , press the lower-left most ( **Exit** )
**footswitch**.

**To change the value** , move the **expression pedal**.

**To fine-tune the value incrementally** , use the lower-right two ( **–** or

##### (4.9) Setlists

A **song** is a group of rigs that are sorted together for optimal organization.
A **setlist** is a saved collection of songs and rigs arranged in a customized
order. After being edited and saved, setlists can be loaded at a later time.
This feature is useful if, for instance, you need only some of your rigs for a
performance; in this case, you could save a setlist with only those rigs so that
you don’t have to spend time searching through all of your rigs while
performing.

**To view your available setlists** , tap the **Menu** icon in the top left of
the **Main** screen, and then tap the **Setlists** icon.

**To load a setlist** :

##### (4.12) Looper

HeadRush Prime has a built-in looper that you can use to layer your
performances. While the looper’s operation is shown in the display, you can
control most of it conveniently with the footswitches.

Each loop can be up to **5 minutes** long, with a maximum of **20 minutes** of
overdubbed audio at a time across a maximum of **50 layers**.

**To access the Looper,** tap the **Menu** icon in the top left of the **Main**
screen, and then tap the **Looper** icon.

**To record the first layer of a loop** , press the **Record** footswitch.
Recording will begin immediately, and the footswitch indicator will light
**red**. Press the **Record** footswitch again to stop recording and start loop
playback. The footswitch is now called **Overdub** and the footswitch indicator
is **yellow**.

**To record additional layers onto the loop** (overdub), press the **Overdub**
footswitch. Overdubbing will begin immediately, and the footswitch indicator
will light **red**. Press the **Overdub** footswitch again to stop overdubbing
and continue playback.

**To erase the top-most** (last-added) **layer of the loop** , press the
**Peel** footswitch. The top-most layer of the loop will be erased immediately.

**To recall the last layer removed,** hold the **Peel** footswitch before
performing any overdub actions.

**To record over a section of the top-most** (last-added) **layer** (like a
punch-in/punch-out function), press the **Insert** footswitch. Recording will
begin immediately, and the footswitch indicator will light **red**. Press the
**Insert** footswitch again to stop recording and continue playback. This
overwrites that section of the top-most layer.

  that are set to “Sync,” as well as the Metronome feature. Set this parameter
  to **Off** to desync the Looper tempo from the global tempo.
- **Global Tempo** : Use this parameter to manually set the global tempo of
  HeadRush Prime using the main **encoder**. You can alternately set this tempo
  by using the tap tempo footswitch.
- **Quantize Changes:** When **Global Tempo Sync** is set to **On** , the tempo
  of the loop will sync to the current internal global tempo, or the received
  MIDI tempo when enabled in the Global Settings.
- **Metronome** : Set this parameter to **Rec** (record) to have the metronome
  only play while the initial layer of the loop is being recorded. Set this
  parameter to **On** to have the metronome play while the loop is recording,
  playing, and overdubbing a layer. Set this parameter to **Off** to disable the
  metronome.
- **Count-In** : Use this parameter to determine a **1** – **4 Bar** count-in
  before a loop begins recording the initial loop layer. Set this parameter to
  **Off** to disable to the count-in bar and begin recording the initial loop
  layer instantly.
- **Time Sig** : Use this parameter to determine the time signature of the
  count-in.
- **Threshold:** Tap the **On** button to enable looper recording to only begin
  when the audio signal has reached a certain threshold. Use the field next to
  this to set the threshold level, from **-60** to **0 dB**.

## (4.14) Tuner

**To access HeadRush Prime’s built-in guitar tuner,** hold the bottom right
footswitch labeled Tap Tempo. Alternatively, you can access the tuner by tapping
the **Menu icon** in the top left of the **Main** screen, and then tapping the
**Tuner** icon.

As you play a string, the screen will show the nearest note, as well as how flat
or sharp the guitar string is. If only a green right arrow appears, your string
is flat, and if only a green left arrow is shown, then your string is sharp. To
successfully tune the string, adjust your guitar’s tuners until both green
arrows are lit.

The following parameters are available to be adjusted:

- **Tuner Reference** : Tap this parameter, then turn the main **encoder** to
  set the tuner’s reference frequency. The default and most common setting for a
  guitar tuner is **440 Hz**.
- **Range** : Tap this parameter, then turn the main **encoder** to set the
  tuner’s pitch reference range. Choose **GUITAR** if you are tuning a
  standard-range 6-string acoustic or electric guitar. Choose **BASS** if you
  are tuning a bass or an extended-range guitar that is tuned low.
- **Tempo** : Tap this parameter to manually set the global tempo of HeadRush
  Prime using the main **encoder**. You can alternately set this tempo by using
  the tap tempo footswitch.

Additionally, you can access additional functionality on the **Tuner** page by
using footswitches depending on the type of rig that you are using:

- **In guitar-only rigs,** you can mute the guitar signal by pressing the
  footswitch labeled **MUTE GTR** , and if the Mic Dry feature is enabled, you
  can mute that vocal signal by pressing the footswitch labeled **MUTE** **VC**.
- **In dual guitar rigs,** you can mute each guitar signal by pressing the
  footswitches labeled **MUTE GT1** and **MUTE GT2** respectively. You can also
  choose which signal is being tuned by pressing the footswitch labeled **TUNE
  GT1** / **TUNE GT2**.
- **In vocal-only rigs,** you can completely mute the vocal signal by pressing
  the footswitch labeled **MUTE VC.** You can also disable all vocal effects and
  use the Mic Dry signal instead by pressing the footswitch labeled **MIC DRY**.
- **In guitar and vocal rigs,** you can mute the guitar signal by pressing the
  footswitch labeled **MUTE GTR** and mute the vocal signal by pressing the
  footswitch with the indicator labeled **MUTE VC.** You can also disable all
  vocal effects and use the Mic Dry signal instead by pressing the footswitch
  labeled **MIC DRY**.

**Tip:** Using the MIC DRY function while on the Tuner page is especially
helpful during performances, as it lets you “talk” to the crowd normally without
effects applied while you are tuning your guitar between songs.

## (4.15) Metronome.......................................

HeadRush Prime includes simple yet convenient built-in **Metronome** that you
can use while practicing.

## (4.17) USB

You can use HeadRush Prime’s USB connection to your computer for **_(4.17.1)
Transferring Files & Settings_** (e.g., rigs, setlists, presets, etc.),
**_(4.17.2) Recording_** (to a digital audio workstation [DAW]), or **_(4.17.3)
Reamping_**.

### (4.17.1) Transferring Files & Settings

Over a USB connection, you can transfer rig, setlist, model preset, loop, clone,
and/or impulse response (IR) files between your computer and HeadRush Prime.

We recommend creating a backup copy of your files to your computer before you
make any changes.

**Important** :

Do **not** disconnect or power off HeadRush Prime during the process.

Any unsupported files will be ignored.

You cannot transfer a folder or .zip/archive folder to/from HeadRush Prime.
Instead, transfer any supported files directly.

We recommend organizing the file structure of your rigs, setlists, model
presets, and/or impulse response files on your computer so that it is identical
to the file structure as shown on the HeadRush Prime “drive.”

**To transfer files between HeadRush Prime and your computer** :

1. Connect your computer to HeadRush Prime’s **USB port** using a standard USB
   cable. 2.^ With your computer powered on, power on HeadRush Prime using the
   **power switch**.
2. Tap the **Menu** icon in the upper-left corner of the **Main** screen, and
   then tap **USB Transfer**.
3. On your computer, HeadRush Prime will appear as a mass-storage device called
   **HeadRush**.

```
Windows users : If this is the first time you’ve connected it to this computer, you may need to wait a minute
while it installs the class-compliant drivers.
```

5. Open the **HeadRush** drive. You can now freely click and drag contents
   between **HeadRush** and your computer. Note that any changes you make to the
   contents of your **HeadRush** are immediate and cannot be cancelled. **Tip**
   : During this step, you can add an image to use with the screen lock feature.
   See **_(4.18) Lock Screen_** to learn more.
6. **IMPORTANT:** When you are finished transferring contents, you must
   **unmount/eject** the HeadRush drive from your computer. File corruption may
   occur if the drive is not properly ejected before continuing.
7. After the drive has been ejected, tap **Sync** on your HeadRush Prime to
   "commit" any changes you made to the contents of the HeadRush drive. As
   HeadRush Prime analyzes and imports the files, a meter on the display will
   indicate its progress. The normal **Menu** screen will reappear when the
   process is finished. Do not disconnect or power off HeadRush Prime during the
   sync process.

### (4.17.2) Recording

When HeadRush Prime’s USB port is connected to your computer, you can select and
use HeadRush Prime as a 24-bit audio interface, enabling you to play audio
through it or to send its audio signal to the computer. It can use sample rates
of 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, or 96 kHz.

**Important Note for Windows Users** : Before connecting HeadRush Prime to your
computer, download the necessary drivers from **support.headrushfx.com** and
install them.

**To use HeadRush Prime as an audio interface with your computer** , open your
computer’s **Control Panel** (Windows®) or **System Preferences** (macOS®), open
its sound/audio settings, and select **HeadRush Prime** as the device for
recording/input and/or for playback/output.

HeadRush Prime can send six separate audio signal channels to your computer.
Before recording HeadRush Prime’s audio signal into your digital audio
workstation (DAW), select the channel/channels you want to record:

```
1 : the left channel of the XLR main outputs with all active effects applied.
2 : the right channel of the XLR main outputs with all active effects applied.
3 : the left channel of the 1/4” main outputs with all active effects applied.
4 : the right channel of the 1/4” main outputs with all active effects applied.
5 : a mono channel of the 1/4” guitar input with no effects applied.
6 : a mono channel of the Combo XLR + 1/4" microphone input with no effects applied.
```

HeadRush Prime can receive four separate audio signal channels from your
computer. The channels are named and routed as follows:

```
1 : the left channel of your computer’s output audio signal, which will be sent directly out of HeadRush Prime’s
main outputs and phones output.
2 : the right channel of your computer’s output audio signal, which will be sent directly out of HeadRush Prime’s
main outputs and phones output.
3 : a mono channel of your computer’s audio signal, which will be sent back through HeadRush Prime (see
(4.17.3) Reamping below).
4 : not used in this scenario.
```

**Important** : Remember to set your DAW’s main outputs to be sent to **1** /
**2**.

### (4.17.3) Reamping

Reamping is a process that adds the tone coloration of an amp to a pre-recorded
audio signal—in this case, sending audio from your DAW through HeadRush Prime
and then recording it back into your DAW. This is useful for saving time because
you can change the sound of an already-recorded guitar track without having to
manually play the same part again.

**To use HeadRush Prime to reamp an audio signal** :

1. In your DAW, make sure **HeadRush Prime** is selected as your audio interface
   for both recording/input and playback/output.
2. Assign the output of the desired track to **3**.
3. On HeadRush Prime, tap the **Menu** icon in the upper-left corner of the
   **Main** screen, and then tap **Global** **Settings**.
4. In the Global Settings screen, tap the **USB Audio** tab located in the
   column on the left side.
5. On the USB audio tab, set your sample rate to be the same sample rate as the
   one in your DAW.
6. Next, for the USB Mode setting, tap **ReAmp**.
7. Once the sample rate and mode settings are confirmed, set **USB Audio** to
   **On**.
8. In your DAW again, create a new audio track and assign its input. For a
   **stereo** input signal, select **1** / **2**. For a **mono** input signal,
   select **1**.
9. Locate the point in your track where you want to start reamping.
10. On HeadRush Prime, select the rig, blocks, or other parameters to achieve
    the sound you want.
11. In your DAW, start audio recording. The track you want to reamp will be sent
    through HeadRush Prime and recorded into the audio track you created
    earlier.

## (4.18) Lock Screen

The Lock Screen feature disables the **touchscreen** and gives you a simple
interface that shows your current rig name, setlist name, and a customizable
image.

**To access the Lock Screen feature,** tap the **Menu** icon in the top left of
the **Main** screen, and then tap the **Lock Screen** icon.

**To exit the Lock Screen feature back to the Menu,** simply tap the touch
screen 3 times.

**To customize the Screen Lock image** , place a **.png** , **.bmp** , **.jpg**
, or **.jpeg** file named **LockScreenLogo** in the root directory of the
**HeadRush** drive while using the **_(4.17.1) Transferring Files and
Setttings_** feature. We recommend using an **800x400** -pixel image (it will be
automatically scaled to this size after transferring it). Note that any changes
you make to the contents of your **HeadRush** are immediate and cannot be
cancelled.

## (4.19) Amp Cloner

The **Amp Cloner** feature enables you to clone the sound of a real guitar or
bass amplifier or pre-amp (with or without speakers), as well as real
distortion, overdrive, and fuzz pedals, and expand the amount of available amp
and effect sounds in your HeadRush Prime. However, please be aware that some
pedals cannot be cloned:

- Certain gated fuzz pedals are not able to be cloned at this time. A “gated
  fuzz” doesn’t mean that there is an actual noise gate in the fuzz pedal, but
  that the bias is shifted so hard, that the signal is cutting out on low input
  volumes (which is a Noise Gate-like behavior).
- Some older fuzz pedals that were designed to be connected to a high-Z (high
  impedance) guitar output (7k to 15k Ohms) are not able to be cloned directly
  into the HeadRush Prime without the use of a ReAmp box.
- Time-based effects like flanger, chorus, and delay effects are unable to be
  cloned at this time.

**To access Amp Cloner** , tap the **Menu** icon in the top left of the **Main**
screen, and then tap the **Amp Cloner** icon. Once **Amp Cloner** has loaded,
you will be guided through an easy 3 step process of preparing to clone your
gear via the on- screen directions shown below. Once you are ready to clone your
gear, tap **Proceed** to begin the process.

1. In **Step 1** , you will choose the type of gear that you would like to
   clone: **Amp & Cab** , **Amp / Pre-Amp** , or **Pedal Only**.
2. In **Step 2** , HeadRush Prime will guide you through the process of
   correctly connecting your Amp or Pedal to HeadRush Prime. During this step,
   you can tap the **Connection Diagram** button to view a visual diagram and
   ensure that your connections are correct. Additionally, you can preview and
   set your signal level using the on-screen meter. **Tip:** While we normally
   recommend targeting a signal level of -6 db to -3 db, some amps may be cloned
   more accurately when the signal level is closer to 0 dB. If you find that
   your clone is lacking gain or body when compared to the target amp, try
   aiming for a higher level. Likewise, if you find that your clone has too much
   gain or body when compared to the target amp, try aiming for a lower level.
3. In **Step 3** , you can match the on-screen controls to the controls on the
   gear being cloned. Matching these controls is helpful as they will be taken
   into consideration if you want to adjust your EQ after the cloning process.
   Once you have matched your controls, tap **Start Clone** to begin the cloning
   process.

Once the cloning process has begun, a progress bar will be shown with details
about what’s happening. You will hear about 1 minute of measurement tones, and
then the remaining time will be spent processing the information. The entire
process lasts about 3 minutes or less; however, you can tap the **Cancel**
button to abort the process at any time.

After the cloning process is complete, you will be brought to a screen where you
are able to preview your clone, as well as compare it to the target device you
cloned. You may choose to refine the clone at this time by tapping the **Amp
Controls** button.

While on this screen, you can make adjustments to the clone’s sound. You can
also switch between the sound of the new clone and the target device.

**Tip:** If you are cloning an Amp & Cab, it is much easier to compare the sound
of your clone to the target Amp & Cab if you place your HeadRush Prime in a
seperate room away from the target Amp & Cab. This can help you listen more
objectively and not get distracted by any sound that you may still be able to
hear while using headphones and listening to the comparisons.

Once you have finished making any last adjustments, tap the **Confirm** button.
You will be brought back to the previous page.

Once you are finished, tap the **Save** button. After you have saved your clone,
you can add your clone to a rig in the same way you would add a traditional amp
model or effect pedal by tapping an empty block on the **Main** page, and
selecting **Amp Clone**.

## (4.20) Mic Dry Out

HeadRush Prime’s **Mic Dry Out** feature enables you to still use a microphone
while using rigs that use guitar-centric signal paths (Straight Path, Middle
Split, Immediate Split) that typically do not allow adding FX to the microphone
input.

This can be useful for different performance situations such as:

- You require the full 14 blocks of your rig to attain a complex guitar sound,
  and while you do not need vocal effects, you still need to sing simple backup
  vocals or talk to the audience between songs.
- You are livestreaming a performance or taking online lessons using your
  HeadRush Prime as an audio interface and you still need a way to talk to your
  viewers or instructor.

**To enable or bypass the Mic Dry Out signal** on these types of rigs, tap the
**Mic** button located on bottom of the Main screen next to the **Tail** and
**Signal Path** buttons.

Although you are unable to add vocal effects to the microphone signal to these
types of rigs, the **Mic Dry Out** configuration screen still enables you to
enhance the **Mic Dry Out** signal with a noise gate, compression, high pass
filter, and simple EQ settings.

**To access the Mic Dry Out configuration screen to further configure this
signal,** tap the **Menu** icon in the top left of the **Main** screen, and then
tap **Mic Dry Out**. On this screen, you can adjust the following settings:
**Preset:** Select from included presets with preconfigured settings for various
uses. **Active:** Enables or disables the Mic Dry Out feature. **Volume:** Sets
the level of the incoming Mic signal. You can monitor the level using the
**meter** above. **Gate Thresh:** This is the volume level below which noise
gate will be applied. Any sound at this level or higher will pass through the
gate. Any sound lower than this level will be reduced. **High Pass:** Adjusts
the center frequency of the high pass filter applied to the mic signal. **Comp
Threshold:** This is the volume level at which compression is applied. Any sound
at this level or higher will be compressed. Any sound at this level or lower
will bypass the compressor. **Comp Make-Up:** Adds additional gain to the
compressed signal. **EQ On:** Enables or disables equalization. When enabled,
you can adjust these additional settings: **EQ Low:** Attenuate or boost the
gain of the low frequency EQ band. **EQ Low Mid:** Attenuate or boost the gain
of the low-mid frequency EQ band. **EQ High-Mid:** Attenuate or boost the gain
of the high-mid frequency EQ band. **EQ High:** Attenuate or boost the gain of
the high frequency EQ band.

## (4.21) Global EQ

The **Global EQ** screen lets you quickly apply additional equalization to
**all** your presets without permanently saving them. These settings are
especially useful when a venue, rehearsal space, or other environment has
different acoustic characteristics than the room where you originally created
your presets (e.g., the venue may sound “boomier,” or a rehearsal space with
soundproofing may deaden some of the high end).

```
To access the Global EQ screen, tap the Menu icon in the top left of the Main screen, and then
tap the Global EQ icon.
```

These settings determine if/how equalization is applied the **XLR outputs** (the
settings on the first tab in the left column) and/or the **1** / **4** ” (
**6.35 mm** ) outputs (the settings on the second tab in the left column half of
the screen). Each equalizer is a four-band parametric equalizer.

The available settings for each set of outputs are as follows: **EQ On** : This
setting determines whether equalization is enabled ( **On** ) or disabled (
**Off** ) for the outputs. **Level** : This setting determines if/how much the
signal level from the outputs is boosted or cut. This value is applied to the
level set by the **Main** knob. **Low Band** & **High Band** : These settings
determine what type of equalization is applied to the lowest-frequency band (
**Low Band** ) and to the highest-frequency band ( **High Band** ): **Shelf** or
**Cut**. **Low** , **Low Mid** , **High** & **High Mid** : The three settings
for each of these four frequency bands determine the shape of the equalization:
The **first setting** ( **Hz** ) determines the center frequency of the **low**
-frequency band, **low-mid** -frequency band, **high** -frequency band, or
**high-mid** -frequency band. The **second setting** ( **dB** ) determines how
much the equalizer boosts or cuts the signal at the corresponding frequency
band. The **third setting** ( **Q** ) determines the width of the frequency
band. The higher the setting, the wider the band will be around the center
frequency (the first setting). This setting is applied whether **Low Band** or
**High Band** is set to **Shelf** or **Cut**.

You can reset the **Global EQ** feature back to the factor defaults by tapping
the **Reset** icon at the bottom of the left column on this screen.

**Note:** This feature is specifically designed for adjusting the sound of every
rig at once to accommodate your performance environment. If you would like to
use an EQ with a similar interface in a specific rig, try the **Para EQ** block,
located in the EQ category when adding a block to a rig.

## (4.22) Global Settings

is triggered **On Release** or **On Press** of the footswitch. When set to **On
Press** , some footswitch functionality will be disabled via hold instead of
press.

**Assign Looper Footswitch** : This setting changes the press function of
**footswitch 6**. This can be assigned to the **Looper** , **Practice Tool** ,
**Tuner,** or **Drum Machine**.

**Remaining Storage:** This meter shows how much storage space is available in
HeadRush Prime’s internal memory. If you want to increase the available memory,
you can back up files to your computer or USB storage device and then delete the
files from HeadRush Prime using the **File Browser** or the **USB Transfer**
feature.

**Color Mod:** If you have trouble distinguishing certain colors on your
HeadRush Prime’s display, or if you just want to further customize the color
scheme, you can use the color mod parameters to adjust their default settings.
If that sounds complicated to you, don’t worry! It is best to learn simply by
experimenting with the settings. While you experiment, a sample of your
adjustments will be shown in real time. See the example below: If you want to
return to the default color scheme, the default settings are as follows:

- **Depth:** 0%
- **Color:** 36 DEG
- **Spread:** 180 DEG **Note:** The **Color Mod** feature is disabled when the
  **Lock Screen** feature is enabled.

### (4.22.2) Audio

##### (4.23) External MIDI Control

HeadRush Prime can be controlled by incoming MIDI CC (control change) messages
sent from external MIDI gear. This external MIDI gear must be connected to the
5-pin **MIDI Input** or the **USB-A** connection. If USB-MIDI gear is being
connected to the USB-A port, it must be class compliant and require no software
drivers to function.

The chart below lists the parameters that can be controlled by external MIDI
gear:

```
CC# Action CC# Action
CC#1 Internal Expression Pedal CC#46 Drum Machine - Mute
CC#2 External Expression Pedal CC#47 Drum Machine - Accent
CC#12 Global Tempo - CC#49 Footswitch 1
CC#13 Global Tempo + CC#50 Footswitch 2

CC#44 Drum Machine - Next/Bridge CC#78 Block 4 Toggle (On/Off)
CC#45 Drum Machine - Outro CC#79 Block 5 Toggle (On/Off)
```

While most of the parameters in the list above are actions that will be
triggered when any CC data value (0-127) is sent along with the correct CC#,
some parameters require specific data values to function properly.

For example:

- When sending CC messages to control the **Internal** and **External Expression
  Pedal** (CC#1 and CC#2), as well as the **Top, Middle** and **Bottom Parameter
  Knobs** (CC#61, CC#62, and CC#63), you can send an exact data value between
  0-127 to make precise settings.
- When sending CC messages to control the **Internal Footswitches** (CC#49
  through CC#60), you must send a data value of 127 to simulate the press, and
  then another CC# message with a data value of 0 to simulate the release of the
  footswitch. If you only send the press data value, the current assigned hold
  function to that internal footswitch will be activated.
- When sending CC messages to control the **Tap Tempo** (CC#64), you must send
  the CC message multiple times to simulate setting the Tap Tempo via an
  internal footswitch.

If your external MIDI device is not controlling the Prime as expected, try
adjusting the CC data values like the examples above, as well as exploring any
settings that may be available on your MIDI device itself. Some MIDI devices
will have specific CC Toggle and CC Momentary modes where one mode may work
better than the other.
