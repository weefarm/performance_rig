Microcosm rearranges and reinterprets your sound in new and exciting ways using
a variety of granular

sampling, delay, and looping techniques. Cascading micro loops can be locked
into tight tap-tempo

synced rhythms, diffused into glacial ambient textures, woven into hypnotic
drones, and much more.

11 groundbreaking effects (with a total of 44 preset variations) allow you to
slice, stretch, rearrange,

and manipulate your playing in musical ways. Tweak the sound further using
Microcosm’s built-in Pitch

Modulation, lush Stereo Reverb (with 4 selectable modes), and Resonant Low-pass
Filter.

The pedal features Tap Tempo for synchronizing these rhythms with other
musicians, and a “Hold”

Sampler section that captures notes or chords to allow for unique harmony and
drone effects.

When you’ve found a sound you like, the built-in stereo Phrase Looper can
capture up to 60 seconds of

your performance and even allows for layering phrases from different effects.
All loops, overdubs, and

settings can be saved and recalled later using the pedal’s 16 user presets.

# 2 | INPUTS & OUTPUTS

The pedal accepts a standard 9v, center-negative, 2.1mm DC barrel connector
power supply. For best results, use an isolated power supply.

## 9V POWER INPUT

```
9 volt
2.1 mm barrel connector, center negative
400 mA minimum
```

Mono/Stereo TRS Input, Output L, Output R, EXP IN, MIDI In, MIDI Out/Thru, 9vDC

## CONNECTIONS

Using a switching power supply or daisy-chain from another pedal can add extra
unwanted noise. The power supply must be capable of providing a minimum of 400
mA to Microcosm.

#### BYPASS OPTIONS:

```
Buffered Bypass: Instrument input remains
buffered when Microcosm is disengaged, offering
a more consistent dry tone and maintaining the
stereo image. Effects immediately stop upon
bypassing pedal.
```

```
Buffered Bypass / Trails Mode: The effect and
loops will fade out naturally when bypassed, but
will not process any new audio until the effect is
engaged again.
```

```
True Bypass Switching: Microcosm uses two
electromechanical relays for the left and right
channels independently. These switch between
the buffered signal (engaged) and unbuffered
signal (disengaged). When bypassed, instrument
input will pass through unaffected by Microcosm.
```

```
*Note: Trails Mode unavailable in true bypass mode
(see Global Configuration).
```

### AUDIO INPUT / OUTPUT

```
Input: Mono / Stereo
Instrument Level or Line Level
Output: Mono / Stereo
Instrument Level or Line Level
```

#### OUTPUT CONFIGURATIONS:

**_Mono In/Out_** : Microcosm is ready to receive a mono input by default ( _see
Global Configuration_ ). Connect a standard instrument cable into the
MONO/STEREO TRS input jack, and a standard instrument cable to OUTPUT L.

**_Mono In/Stereo Out_** : Connect a standard instrument cable into MONO/STEREO
TRS input jack. Use standard instrument cables with both output L & R for a
stereo image of the mono input.

**_Stereo In/ Stereo Out_** : First, select the stereo input option in the
Global Configuration menu ( _see pg. 45_ ) Connect a TRS stereo cable into the
MONO/STEREO TRS input jack. Use standard instrument cables to connect from both
OUTPUT L & R to your output destination.

**_Stereo In/ Mono Out_** : When sending a stereo signal into the stereo TRS
Input, use only OUTPUT L to sum to mono.

### EXPRESSION PEDAL INPUT

If an Expression Pedal is plugged in to the 1/4” “EXP” jack while the pedal is
powered on, Indicator Lights will flash blue. While flashing, move the control
to which you’d like to assign the Expression Pedal.

```
Tip: 0-3v input
Ring: 3v output
Sleeve: 0v output
Recommended pot resistance: >10 kOhm
Control Parameters: Activity, Shape, Filter, Mix,
Repeats, Space, or Loop Level
```

This Expression Pedal assignment will persist after cycling power; to skip this
step on subsequent uses of the pedal, plug in the Expression Pedal before
powering on the pedal. To keep the same assignment, don’t touch any controls
while the Indicator Lights flash after plugging it in.

## INDICATOR LIGHTS

```
As you turn the Preset Selector , an amber cursor
will indicate your location within the active effect
bank. Each effect contains 4 presets ( A-D ). Idle the
cursor over the desired preset slot to select. Upon
selection, the surrounding bars will animate.
```

# 3 | NAVIGATION & CONTROLS

#### SAVING PRESETS

### 3 | NAVIGATION & CONTROLS CONT.

```
Controls the density of the effects.
Turn clockwise to add complexity
and variety. Activity function varies
preset to preset ( see Effects ).
```

### ACTIVITY

```
Determines the effect duration or frequency.
Works in tandem with Activity knob. Repeats
function varies preset to preset ( see Effects ).
```

### REPEATS

```
Secondary Control: sets Pitch Modulation
depth.
```

```
Activity + Repeats: the Activity and Repeats controls work together to provide a wide variety of tonal
options for each preset. In general, Activity gives you “more” or “less” of what each preset does,
and Repeats controls how long the effect goes on for. But rather than controlling any one specific
parameter, Repeats and Activity are both sophisticated macro controls that encompass many
different parameters to help you control each effect.
For example, in the Tunnel bank of effects, Activity controls the depth of the sample and filter
manipulation, while Repeats adjusts the amount of time it takes for the drone to decay.
```

Controls either the Time Subdivision or Global Tempo.

```
SUBDIV: Determines the musical subdivision of the effect.
```

```
TEMPO: Time knob sets the overall global tempo. This mode offers a
manual alternative to Tap Tempo and allows for smooth acceleration/
deceleration of the tempo. In this mode, the effect subdivision is always
set to quarter notes.
```

```
*Note: Tap Tempo will still work while Tempo Mode is active.
```

Tapping this button will toggle the function of the **Time** knob between
Subdivisions or Global Tempo. The corresponding light beneath the button
indicates the active setting.

When held, this button functions as a **Shift** control, allowing access to a
knob’s Secondary Control. Secondary Controls are labeled in gray text beneath
the corresponding knob.

## 5 | HOLD SAMPLER

The Hold Sampler allows you to capture and sustain the most recent segment of
your playing indefinitely. Held samples sustain when changing effects and
parameters.

The sampled material is continuously fed back into the effects section. This
allows the effects to dynamically process the captured material. Mixing in dry
signal will allow you to play on top of these sustained textures.

```
*Note: Activating the Phrase Looper will clear any material
captured by the Hold Sampler. The Hold Sampler is not
accessible while Phrase Looper is active.
```

```
The Hold Sampler can be configured
for either Toggle or Momentary
operation ( see Global Configuration ).
```

# 6 | PHRASE LOOPER

Use the Phrase Looper to record and play back up to 60 seconds of a performance.
You can infinitely record to the Overdub Layer upon loop playback. Clear the
Overdub Layer and return to the initial phrase with the undo feature. Customize
the looper to your preference with any combination of configuration options.
Loops can be saved and recalled within User Presets.

```
PHRASE LOOPER ON/OFF - Press to activate or
deactivate the phrase looper. The button will glow
when the looper is engaged, and the footswitch
functions will change accordingly.
```

```
*Press and hold to enter Looper Configuration mode.
```

**REVERSE** - Tap to reverse playback of the recorded material. If reverse is
enabled while recording your initial phrase, it will be reversed upon playback.

```
When engaged, a pulsing light indicates that
the looper is armed and ready to record.
A solid light indicates recorded material is
currently stored within the looper.
```

```
(ready to record) (loaded loop)
```

## DEFAULT LOOPER FUNCTIONALITY

When **Phrase Looper** is active, the left and right footswitches allow you to
record, play, stop, and erase audio.

**RECORDING A PHRASE** : Press the left footswitch to begin recording a phrase.
The Indicator Lights will glow red while the audio is being captured. Press the
left footswitch again when you are ready to close the loop and begin playback.
The Indicator Lights will glow green and the recorded phrase will immediately
begin playback.

**_\*Note:_** _Maximum recording time for initial phrase is 60 seconds. As a
warning, the phrase looper button will blink during the last 5 seconds of
available recording time._

**OVERDUB LAYER** : You can infinitely record on top of your looped phrase by
adding to the Overdub Layer. While your loop is playing, press the left
footswitch to begin overdubbing (Indicator Lights will glow yellow). Press the
left footswitch to return to normal playback.

**UNDO OVERDUB LAYER** : To erase the Overdub Layer _but retain the initial
phrase_ , press and hold the left footswitch (Indicator Lights will flash
yellow).

**STOP/ERASE LOOP** : Press the right footswitch to stop loop playback. This
action will end playback but retain the recording for recall. Press the left
footswitch to return to phrase playback.

To completely erase the recorded phrase, press and hold the right footswitch.
The Indicator Lights will flash red and green alternately when the phrase has
been deleted from memory.

### ADDITIONAL PHRASE LOOPER CONFIGURATION

```
(1) Microcosm’s Phrase Looper has
several configuration options that change
the looper’s default behavior. To access
these options, press and hold the Phrase
Looper button.
```

```
(2) The amber cursor will begin to flash
within the Phrase Looper section. Rotate
the Preset Selector to scroll through the
configurations. Tap the Preset Selector to
toggle an option on or off.
Hold the Phrase Looper button again to
exit looper configuration.
These settings will be preserved when
saving a User Preset and persist after
power cycling the pedal.
```

```
STEP 1 STEP 2
```

```
*Looper configurations can be toggled at any
time without disrupting looper playback.
```

### LOOPER PLAYBACK SPEED

```
When assigned to Subdiv , the knob scrolls
through predetermined playback speeds.
```

```
When assigned to Tempo , turning the knob results
in a fluid speed shift anywhere from 1/4 to 4x.
```

Determine the looper playback speed by holding **Shift** and turning the
**Time** knob.

**_\*Note:_** _In both assignments, the_ **_“TAP”_** _interval (1X) returns
looper playback to normal speed. Looper playback speed maxes out at “4X”._

```
(Press & Hold) (Press & Hold)
```

### 6 | PHRASE LOOPER CONTINUED

With **Pre-FX** selected, the **Phrase Looper** will be routed in front of the
effect. This means any recorded material will be sent through effect processing.
This allows for manipulation of the phrase without altering the recorded
material. The loop will be processed just like the instrument input.

```
By default the looper is
routed post-FX, for recording
Microcosm’s effects.
```

#### PRE-FX

```
*Tip: Experiment with the two
routing options. Try recording
an effect in the default post-FX
mode, then sending that loop
back through the effects again.
Both options offer very different
experiences. Routing configuration
will be saved within User Presets.
```

#### QUANTIZE

Quantize synchronizes your loops with the tempo of the effects section. This
mode can produce extraordinarily complex compositions, as sequences and
interlocking rhythmic elements can be continually layered while remaining in
sync.

When the Phrase Looper is set to **Quantize** , Microcosm will trim your loop to
the nearest beat in order to synchronize the loop to the effect tempo. The
effect tempo must be set before recording starts. Starting a Phrase Looper
recording will synchronize the effect and looper start points. When you finish
recording the loop, Microcosm will “round” the loop length to the nearest
quarter note and trim the loop accordingly.

**_\*Note:_** _effect subdivision can be changed freely while Quantize mode is
active, but if the global tempo changes, the effect and loop will no longer be
in sync. Simply switching presets will reset the global tempo to the quantized
loop’s tempo while this mode is active, re-syncing the effect and loop tempos._

### 6 | PHRASE LOOPER CONTINUED

### LOOPER ORDER OF OPERATION

```
Alternatively, this option allows you to
immediately start recording material
the moment you close the loop.
```

```
Press the left footswitch again to return
to normal playback.
```

Microcosm offers two common workflows for recording loops. Select the option in
Global Configuration Mode.

```
The default order of operations is as follows:
a. Press left footswitch to begin recording.
b. Press again to close the loop and begin
playback.
c. Press again to begin recording an overdub.
```

```
RECORD > PLAY > OVERDUB (default)
```

##### RECORD > OVERDUB > PLAY

#### LOOPER ONLY

Looper Only mode allows you to mute the effects and use the pedal as a
traditional looper.

**\*** _Pitch Modulation, Reverb, and Filter remain active in Looper Only mode.
Mix allows you to blend back and forth._

#### BURST

Burst allows for the creation of fast, one-layer loops. In Burst mode, the left
footswitch will record a loop only while the left footswitch is depressed.
Playback begins immediately upon release. Depressing the footswitch again will
immediately delete the phrase and begin capturing new audio.

This setting disables overdub recording, but it provides a special immediacy
when recording and playing back loops that can be useful for creative
performance styles.

**\*** _Phrases recorded in Burst mode will not be saved within_ **_User
Presets_** _unless Burst is deselected after recording._

### 6 | PHRASE LOOPER CONTINUED

# 7 | SAVING PRESETS

Once you’ve found a sound you like you can save these settings for later recall.

Microcosm’s User Preset section has 16 save slots, organized into 4 color coded
banks (Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue). User Presets will retain any parameters
and loops that were active at the time of saving. Any overdubs will be “mixed
down” into a single loop file so that additional overdubs can be layered on top
in future performances.

**Global Configuration** settings are not saved with User Presets.

**_To save current settings, follow these steps:_**

```
STEP 1
```

```
(1) Hold down the Preset Selector
until the Indicator Lights flash blue. This
indicates that the settings and recorded
phrase have been copied.
```

##### STEP 2

##### STEP 3

```
(2) Cursor will blink to indicate copied
material. Turn to the desired User Preset
slot and hold down the Selector again to
save the preset.
```

```
To cancel and return to normal
operation, click the Preset Selector.
```

```
(3) Indicator Lights will flash blue as
information is stored. Once lights stop flashing
then all of the pedal’s current parameters and
any recorded phrases will be saved for future
use.
```

```
*Note : Longer recording times may take
longer to save than presets with shorter loops.
```

### LOADING USER PRESETS

The User Preset section has 16 save slots in 4 color-coded banks (Red, Yellow,
Green, and Blue). Select a User Preset by scrolling to the end of the effects
section to the bank labeled **User**. Scroll to the desired slot to load saved
parameters and any recorded material.

### PREVIEWING & OVERWRITING USER PRESETS

##### PREVIEW USER PRESETS

You might want to preview a User Preset before you overwrite with new material.
While your settings are copied ( _see “Step 1” of Saving Presets_ ) the pedal
will still operate and load presets. This allows you to sample saved loops or
test saved effects before overwriting the copied effect.

**OVERWRITE PRESET / SAVE IN PLACE**

If the chosen **User** slot is already in use at the time of saving, the new
settings will overwrite and replace the previous material. Likewise, any changes
made to a User preset can be saved in place by copying the settings and saving
to the same slot.

**\*** **_Note:_** _Knob position does not necessarily reflect the actual
settings when using saved presets. The User presets retain settings from the
moment they were saved. If you want to tweak a parameter, simply turn the knob
and the setting will be updated to the actual knob position._

You might have a saved loop but want to experiment with other effect options. In
this case, you can transfer a loop from within a User Preset back to the effect
section. To do this, follow the same pattern as saving presets.

Idle the cursor over the User Preset that contains the loop you want to
transfer. Press and hold the Preset Selector until the Indicator Lights flash,
indicating the loop has been copied. Navigate out of the user bank, turn to the
desired effect, and hold selector again. Once the teal lights stop blinking, the
loop will be ready for playback within the effect section.

### COPYING LOOPS

**\*** **_Note_** : _User Preset settings will not transfer to live effect
section. Additionally, the transferred loop will overwrite any loop present at
the time of saving._

## CONTROL CHANGE

Microcosm’s controls can be accessed and manipulated via MIDI CC messages.

Microcosm echoes any messages it receives on its MIDI IN port on the MIDI OUT
port by default, so that other devices can be used simultaneously with a single
MIDI connection from a MIDI source. The pedal listens for commands on Channel 1
by default, so other devices connected via MIDI OUT/THRU should be configured to
listen on another channel. Alternatively, Microcosm’s default MIDI channel can
be changed in Global Configuration.

### CLOCK

Microcosm accepts MIDI clock signals via the MIDI IN jack. When it receives a
MIDI Start message, the pedal will switch from its internal clock to the
external clock signal. Upon receiving a MIDI Stop message, the pedal will revert
to its internal clock. Note that Tap Tempo is not available when synchronized to
an external clock. In addition to receiving MIDI clock, Microcosm can also
transmit MIDI clock signals via the MIDI OUT jack.

### THRU

Sending a Program Change message to the pedal will allow the user to switch
between any of the 44 effect variations and 16 user presets.
