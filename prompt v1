We're going to define a live performance-geared guitar effect control and
guitar+vocal looper rig. It will be fairly complex, so you should start in
planning mode.

First, the inventory of equipment available to use:

- iConnectivity mioXM midi interface (see owner's manual in HardwareUserManuals)
- Voodoo labs Ground Control Pro (see owners manual in HardwareUserManuals)
- Behringer FCB1010_WINO2 (FCB1010 with UNO2 Firmware & WINO2 extension module
  installed; see documents in HardwareUserManuals)
- Stock Behringer FCB1010 - no modifications (See manual in HardwareUserManuals)
- NeuralDSP QuadCortex - (See user manual in HardwareUserManuals)
- HeadRush Prime - (See user manual in HardwareUserManuals)
- Hologram Electronics Microcosm - (See manual in HardwareUserManuals)

I would like to create a setup to integrate as many of these items as necessary.
My primary design considerations for the setup include:

- limited memory available for programming WINO2
- primary guitar tone effects (amp clones/overdrives/distortions, scenes, etc.
  ambient looping using QC or microcosm via fx loop) handled by QuadCortex,
  primarily time-based effects/delay and main performance looping handled by HRP
- looper: it would be great to integrate the QC & HRP's looper controls on one
  board/bank, such that I could start recording/overdubbing/playing/etc. for
  either looper from a single visible bank of footswitches. This should be
  possible given the flexibility of the mioXM to reinterpret midi messages, the
  flexibility of the WINO2's programming, and the switch real estate the
  GroundControl Pro offers.
- My intention is to primarily use the hrp looper for main song structure
  (guitar+vocals) since it will hold multiple layers/loops.
    - the QC will provide an option to create smaller/shorter "part" loops or
      one shots, so that I can set a loop running on the QC, play along or sing
      along to it while capturing both its loop and the live additions on the
      HRP..
- I want a dedicated switch for activating the microcosm, with a momentary mode
  and a latching mode available.
- For the QC's expression pedals, I will use:

* one of the QC's analog expression pedal inputs to control wah
* the other of the QC's analog expression pedal inputs to control master rig
  volume (main outs)

- The other expression pedals available include:

* 2 on FCB1010 Stock
* 2 on FCB1010 wino2
* 1 built in to the HRP, which could be used to control either its mix of
  dry/effected signal for the time-based delay/reverb/etc OR the mix of live
  signal vs. looper signal to its output. Parameters that would likely get
  assigned to expression pedals include:
* FX Loop (microcosm) mix - probably one of the QC's FX loops
* QC FXLoop 2 (HRP) mix
* Others undecided at this time, but could be individual loop volume(s),
  loop-live mix levels, etc.

You will need to plan:

- the connections between various pieces of equipment such that midi information
  is sent to the right device on the right channel at the right time when
  footswitches are pressed
- the setup of the mioXM to handle relaying altered midi from the GCPro and/or
  stock FCB1010 as needed to provide the correct midi input to the mapped
  devices
- the programming of the FCB1010 WINO2 to stay within its memory limits (see
  fcb1010_cleaned.txt for a revised version of my original attempt at
  implementation)
- proper state considerations for led on/off to indicate
  record/overdub/play/etc. with respect to the loopers (focusing on controlling
  the HRP's ability to create and modify song-structure level looping) and
  effect off/on with respect to the various mapped effects
- possible daisy-chaining of effects to stay within the number of midi in/out
  DIN ports available, or alternative methods of MIDI connectivity as available
- a strategy to make the code pertaining to various components of the rig as
  readable and editable as possible, with minimal hard-coding of parameters that
  could be coded as variables instead, whenever possible
- a workflow with easy accessibility for:

* QC scenes and stomps
* HRP effects & their adjustment paremeters
* QC looper & HRP (primary) looper

- minimized number of keypresses (it is hard to play while "tapdancing") for
  navigation, bank switching, etc.
- momentary and latching modes for at least microcosm and looper, where
  possible, as well as for HRP effects

So the overall gist is QC as a guitar effects unit, with individual QC FX loops
containing :

- the microcosm & the QC's looper for ambient soundscape building
- HRP for vocal effects & overall song performance looping

And midi control off the entire rig using the availbe routing options and
switching hardware.
